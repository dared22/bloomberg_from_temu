(Photo by MADS CLAUS RASMUSSEN/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP via Getty Images) Mads Claus Rasmussen | Afp | Getty Images A leadership shakeup at what was once Europe's most valuable company was cemented Friday as Novo Nordisk 's controlling shareholder tightened it's grip on the weight-loss drugmaker, even as minority shareholders express discontent. Novo has found itself in an increasingly chaotic situation as of late, with shares plunging and investor confidence waning, as its role as the leading player in the highly lucrative weight-loss space is being called into question. The maker of diabetes and weight-loss drugs replaced its independent board members , including Chair Helge Lund, after it became impossible to reach an agreement between the views of the current board and the Novo Nordisk foundation board \u2014 the company's majority shareholder. The intention to replace the members were announced on Oct. 21. Lund is replaced by company veteran Lars Rebien S\u00f8rensen, already chair of the Foundation board. The 71-year-old also served as Novo Nordisk CEO between 2000 and 2016. Cees de Jong was elected vice chair and Britt Meelby Jensen and Stephan Engels elected members. Shareholders approved the changes with 93% voting in favor. The foundation controls over 75% of votes. Mikael Dolsten, formerly head of R&D at Pfizer, decided to withdraw his candidacy ahead of the meeting, due to what S\u00f8rensen said was \"a situation relating to his former employer.\" Novo was until recently caught up in a bidding war with Pfizer over smaller biotech Metsera. watch now VIDEO 12:58 12:58 Watch CNBC's full interview with Novo Nordisk CEO Mike Doustdar Squawk Box Europe Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), one of the larger minority shareholders, said earlier this week it would abstain from voting at Friday's EGM, indicating discontent. Other shareholders, such as California State Teachers' Retirement System, also said they intended to vote against the proposal. NBIM and CalSTRS both declined to comment further. S\u00f8rensen acknowledged Friday that some shareholders \u2014 including influential ones \u2014 have indicated discontent because of trespassing of the governance rules, but flagged the intention of getting back to a \"normal situation\" as soon as possible. \"I will enter the board with an intention of holding this position for a period of two to three years,\" S\u00f8rensen said. \"My mandate is very clear; I have two important tasks together with the board, first to support the CEO and the management in its transformation plans to regain its competitive, leadership, and second, preparing the way for my successor.\" Novo shares were down 3.2% to $308.25 in midday trading. \"It is rare that a company of that scale to make that degree of change that quickly,\" Andrew Pettigrew, Emeritus professor at University of Oxford, and an expert of theories of change, told CNBC. \"It's ",

The company announced the package, which could be worth nearly $1 trillion in stock, in September. Between Musk's extensive holdings and his loyal base of followers, the CEO is very likely to succeed. In this article TSLA Follow your favorite stocks CREATE FREE ACCOUNT Tesla is expected to announce on Thursday the results of a shareholder vote determining whether CEO Elon Musk should receive a pay package of nearly $1 trillion worth of stock over the next decade. There's little mystery to the outcome. The electric vehicle company has suggested that shareholders approve the plan. Between Musk's substantial ownership and a hefty base of retail investors who almost always vote with the CEO, the numbers are difficult for the opposition, even though top proxy advisors Glass Lewis and ISS recommended voting against the package. Results of the vote are expected to be shared after Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas. Elon Musk, CEO of SpaceX and Tesla, attends the Viva Technology conference at the Porte de Versailles exhibition center in Paris on June 16, 2023. Gonzalo Fuentes | Reuters Board Chair Robyn Denholm, and other Musk fans, have argued that the outsized pay plan would keep Musk at the helm of the company, and that he's critical to Tesla's future and its ability to compete in robotics and artificial intelligence. Baron Capital's Ron Baron said in a lengthy post on X, Musk's social network, that he's supporting the Tesla CEO. \"Elon is the ultimate 'key man' of key man risk,\" Baron wrote. \"Without his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\" But there are some vocal opponents. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund, managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), said it would vote no. Norges is one of Tesla's top shareholders. \"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk \u2014 consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" NBIM said in a statement this week. watch now VIDEO 5:52 05:52 Ron Baron on Elon Musk: I'd hope that he would be 'a little less visible' Squawk Box Shareholder advocate and governance expert James McRitchie, who drives a Tesla, is also opposing the plan. The company needs to address a number of risks, he said, especially around demand and profitability with the sunsetting of federal EV tax credits that have long incentivized purchases. \"Tesla has all these fanboys. So many retail investors bought the stock because they love the cars,\" McRitchie said. \"There's a lot to love there, but you should also pay attention to the finances and risks.\" Tesla shares are up 14% this year after a steep third-quarter rally lifted the stock into the green following a brutal start to 2025. Musk's purchase of $1 billion worth of stock aided the rebound. Zoom In Icon Arrows pointing outwards CNBC 'Robot army' Tesla introduced the new pay plan in September. The package for Musk, already the world's richest person, consists of 12 tranches of shares to be granted if Tesla hits certain milestones over the next decade. It would also give Musk increased voting power over the company, acceding to demands that he's made publicly since early 2",

PHOTO: REUTERS Follow topic: Tesla Published Nov 05, 2025, 08:05 AM Updated Nov 05, 2025, 05:16 PM OSLO - Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Tesla\u2019s sixth-largest outside investor, said on Nov 4 it would vote against ratifying a proposed pay deal for chief executive Elon Musk potentially worth US$1 trillion (S$1.3 trillion). Mr Musk\u2019s pay package is still seen as likely to win, given broad investor support in the past and the backing Tesla enjoys from its large retail shareholder base. Laws in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters in 2024, also allow the world\u2019s richest man to vote his own large stake, giving him 15.3 per cent of voting power including restricted stock granted in August. The opposition from stewardship-minded Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) was no surprise. But its direct criticism of the compensation and planned votes against two Tesla board directors add uncertainty to the outcome of a ballot set for Nov 6, corporate governance experts said, and underscore how other European investors may also turn against the electric vehicle maker. Tesla chair warns Musk could quit Tesla\u2019s board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with chairwoman Robyn Denholm warning that Mr Musk could leave the US$1.5 trillion market cap firm if the deal is rejected. \u201cEuropean voters are much more likely to be swayed by where Norges goes, because of the general support of ESG (environmental, social and governance) principles and concerns into their investment philosophy,\u201d said Mr Francis Byrd, a partner at consulting firm Alchemy Strategies Partners. Mr Byrd and several other consultants said they expect Tesla\u2019s recommendations to prevail at the meeting, since top investors have stuck with him so far. They also noted how big US investors are under pressure from the Trump administration to apply less public pressure on companies. That could make it harder to know if there is much opposition until the day of the meeting, said Ms Karla Bos, an independent governance consultant in Arizona. \u201cLess predictability is the watchword for 2025, and certainly for complicated votes like at Tesla,\u201d Ms Bos said. Proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject Mr Musk\u2019s compensation plan, arguing it would be too large, delivering high payouts even if the CEO meets only some goals, and could dilute the holdings of other investors. Both also opposed a re-ratification vote in 2024 on a 2018 US$56 billion package for Mr Musk. NBIM said on its website: \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk \u2013 consistent with our views on executive compensation.\u201d With a 1.12 per cent stake in Tesla, NBIM is the only one of Tesla\u2019s top 10 outside investors to disclose its voting intentions ahead of the meeting so far. NBIM also voted \u201cno\u201d on Mr Musk\u2019s previous compensation plan, drawing a sharp response from the CEO, who turned down an invitation to a conference in Oslo. Tesla\u2019s sales in Norway fell 50 per cent in October, along with declines in some other European markets, amid rising competition and backlash to Mr Musk\u2019s political alliance with US President Donald Trump. NBIM, which runs US$2.1 trillion, also said it would vote against Tesla\u2019s proposed general stock compensation plan, which is intended for all employees and can also be used by the board to benefit Mr Musk. Tesla says its CEO would earn \u201cnothing\u201d unless the company\u2019s market value grows substantially and that the maximum award is paid only if the group reaches several milestones, most notably a market value of US$8.5 trillion, a near sixfold increase.

Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), the world's largest such fund, voted against the proposal despite support from investors including Baron Capital. Several major institutional investors have yet to declare their positions ahead of the 6 November vote. NBIM, which manages Norway's considerable oil and gas resources that accrue hundreds of billions of euros in profit annually, is troubled by the compensation package. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk - consistent with our views on executive compensation. We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,\u201d it said . The market reacted negatively to the news, and Tesla's stock is down by more than 4.4 percent today at the time of writing. Tesla's board chair Robyn Denholm warned last week that Musk might leave if the proposed stock award - potentially worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years - isn't approved. He urged shareholders to greenlight it. Musk became Tesla's largest shareholder and chairman in 2004, then CEO in 2007. Under his leadership revenue increased from about $200 million in 2011 to around $95 billion today, however, growth stalled in the past year. Tesla on the wrong tracks with Fail Self Driving, Senators worry Tesla bets on bot smoke screen as political and market realities bite Florida jury throws huge fine at Tesla in Autopilot crash Musk's antics and distractions are backfiring as Tesla's car business stalls The SpaceX billionaire's has stoked controversy in recent times for his political opinions and outbursts, including his Nazi-like salute at President Trump's inauguration, his role dismantling USAID while leading DOGE, and his support for UK far-right activist Tommy Robinson. One study claimed Musk\u2019s approach to politics has cost Tesla one million US EV sales. Sales in Europe have also tanked over the last year. If Musk fails to convince Tesla investors that he continues to be a safe pair of hands in the car company\u2019s driving seat, he can be assured that he and his billionaire cohorts have enjoyed a worthwhile journey together. Research from UK charity Oxfam has found that the collective wealth of the top 10 US billionaires \u2014including Musk \u2014 has increased by $698 billion over the last year. Musk\u2019s net worth is estimated at $497 billion. \u00ae Share More about Share 118 COMMENTS TIP US OFF Send us news Other stories you might like Anthropic is at the heart of the latest billion-dollar circular AI investment bonanza What do you get when you combine Anthropic, Microsoft, and Nvidia?

( Reuters: Gonzalo Fuentes ) In short: Norway's sovereign wealth fund says it will vote against a proposed $1.5 trillion pay deal to Tesla chief executive Elon Musk. The world's largest sovereign wealth fund holds the seventh-biggest stake in the electric car maker, and is so far the biggest shareholder to say how it plans to vote. What's next? Opponents of the pay deal face an uphill battle to stop Mr Musk's proposed compensation package, which will be formally voted on on November 6. abc.net.au/news/musk-1-trillion-pay-packet-rejected-by-major-shareholder/105972264 Link copied Share Share article Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, has announced it will vote against ratifying Tesla chief executive Elon Musk's proposed compensation package that is potentially worth $US1 trillion ($1.54 trillion) at an annual general meeting later this week. Investors in the electric vehicle maker will decide on November 6 whether to approve the package, likely the largest-ever chief executive compensation agreement. Critics have called the pay deal excessive but face an uphill fight against it. Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with chair Robyn Denholm warning that Mr Musk could leave the $1.5 trillion market cap firm if the deal is rejected. Opponents worry that it will give the world's richest man too much unchecked power. Mr Musk's new trillion-dollar pay package will almost certainly pass, given broad investor support. Laws in Texas, where Tesla moved its headquarters last year, also allow Musk to vote his own large stake, giving him some 13.5 per cent of voting power. Elon Musk became CEO of electric car company Tesla in October 2008. ( ABC News: Daniel Mercer ) Wealth fund 'concerned' about pay package size The Norwegian wealth fund is the largest investor so far to say how it plans to vote. The next largest to do so, Baron Capital, plans to back Mr Musk's pay package. Tesla's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their voting plans. Elon Musk becomes world's first half trillionaire The Tesla and SpaceX CEO's net worth hit $US500 billion ($755 billion) on Wednesday, the \"Real-Time Billionaires\" tracker reported. Proxy advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject Mr Musk's compensation plan, arguing it would be too large, deliver high payouts even if the chief executive only met some goals and could dilute the holdings of other investors. Both also opposed a shareholder vote last year on a 2018 $56 billion package for Mr Musk that passed with overwhelming support from Tesla's army of mum-and-dad investors. While the package could grant stock worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the cost of those shares at the time of the award will be deducted, making the value to Mr Musk slightly lower, at up to $878 billion, according to a Reuters analysis. \"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk \u2014 consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" Norges Bank Investment Management said on its website.

The $2.1 trillion Norwegian fund also said it would vote against Tesla's proposed general stock compensation plan, which is intended for all employees and can also be used by the board to benefit Musk. Tesla says its CEO would earn \"nothing\" unless the company's market value grows substantially and that the maximum award is only paid if the group reaches several milestones, most notably a market value of $8.5 trillion, a near six-fold increase.

The wealth fund holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla with a value of 118.3 billion Norwegian kroner ($11.6 billion). Tesla CEO Elon Musk attends the Saudi-U.S. Investment Forum, in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, May 13, 2025. Hamad I Mohammed | Reuters Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said it will vote against Elon Musk's trillion-dollar pay package at Tesla 's annual shareholder meeting this week, rebelling against management guidance and threats from Musk to step down if the deal is rejected. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), which manages the fund \u2014 the largest of its kind in the world, and a major shareholder in Tesla \u2014 said on Tuesday that it had already cast its vote against Musk's remuneration package as CEO of the carmaker. \"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" NBIM said in a statement. \"We will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics,\" the fund's managers added. Norway's wealth fund holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla, according to its half-year filings in June. The value of that investment was last declared to be 118.3 billion Norwegian kroner ($11.6 billion). Tesla shares were 2.5% lower in premarket trade. Tesla's Board of Directors is asking shareholders to approve a pay plan for Musk that could see him granted almost $1 trillion in stock and expand his voting powers at the company. The full award would be contingent on Tesla hitting certain milestones over the next 10 years. The proposals have raised eyebrows and been met with opposition from some company watchers. Last month, the Take Back Tesla campaign \u2014 a coalition of unions and corporate watchdogs \u2014 urged shareholders to reject the deal , while proxy advisories Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also recommended investors vote against the compensation package. Musk has hit back at those recommendations, labeling ISS and Glass Lewis \"corporate terrorists\" on an analyst call . \"Tesla is worth more than all other automotive companies combined,\" Musk wrote in a post on X last month in response to a critic of the pay proposal. \"Which of those CEOs would you like to run Tesla? It won't be me.\" Representatives for Musk and Tesla were not immediately available to comment on NBIM's vote against the proposed CEO compensation package. However, Musk has butted heads with NBIM over his pay in the past. Last year, NBIM voted against reinstating Musk's $56 billion pay deal after it was rescinded by a U.S. judge. The package \u2014 the largest public executive compensation plan in U.S. history \u2014 was ultimately approved by Tesla's shareholders . Following the vote, the Financial Times and Norwegian newspaper E24 published text messages exchanged between Musk and NBIM Chief Executive Nicolai Tangen, which showed the Tesla CEO declining an invitation to a dinner in Norwegian capital Oslo. \"When I ask you for a favor, which I very rarely do, and you decline, then you should not ask me for one until you've done something to make amends,\" Musk reportedly wrote. \"Friends are as friends do.\" Musk is the world's wealthiest perso",

Investors in the electric-vehicle maker will decide on November 6 whether to approve the package, likely the largest-ever CEO compensation agreement, which critics have called excessive. So far, the Norwegian wealth fund is the largest outside Tesla investor to say how it plans to vote. The next-largest to do so, Baron Capital, said yesterday it would back Musk's pay package. The company's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their voting plans. Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with Chair Robyn Denholm warning last week that Musk could leave the company if the deal is rejected. While the package could grant stock worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the cost of those shares at the time of the award will be deducted, making the value to Musk slightly lower, at up to $878 billion, according to a Reuters analysis. \"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk - consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" Norges Bank Investment Management said on its website. The fund, Tesla's seventh-biggest owner with a 1.12% stake worth $17 billion, also voted \"no\" to Musk's previous compensation plan, drawing a sharp response from the CEO, who turned down an invitation to a conference in Oslo. Various groups have tried and failed to block record payouts to Musk, including a $56 billion compensation plan for 2018 that investors reapproved last year, though legal challenges remain. NBIM also said it would vote against two out of three Tesla directors who are up for reelection, declining to back board veterans Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Ira Ehrenpreis while supporting Joe Gebbia, who joined in 2022. The $2.1 trillion Norwegian fund also said it would vote against Tesla's proposed general stock compensation plan, which is intended for all employees and can also be used by the board to benefit Musk. Tesla says its CEO will earn \"nothing\" unless the company's market value grows substantially and that the maximum award is only paid if the group reaches several milestones, most notably a market value of $8.5 trillion, a near six-fold increase. Yet Musk could still reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting many of those targets, according to experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends. Top US investment firms are under pressure from Republican politicians to pay less attention to environmental, social and governance concerns at companies in which they invest and Musk has been an ally of President Donald Trump. The political pressure makes it harder for large investors to vote independently, said Matt Moscardi, CEO of director analytics firm Free Float Analytics. Top investors, Moscardi said, \"at this point, almost can't vote against management.\" More stories on News Business Elon Musk Tesla Norway wealth fund Accreditation: Reuters News Sport Entertainment Business Lifestyle Culture Player TV Radio Gaeilge Weather Archives Brainstorm History Discover Discover RT\u00c9 Games RT\u00c9 Archives RT\u00c9 Brainstorm History Gaeilge RT\u00c9 Learn Food RT\u00c9 Food RT\u00c9 Recipes Watch Watch RT\u00c9 Player TV RT\u00c9 One RT\u00c92 RT\u00c9 News RT\u00c9jr Listen Listen Radio Podcasts RT\u00c9 Radio 1 RT\u00c9 2FM RT\u00c9 lyric fm RT\u00c9 Raidi\u00f3 na Gaeltachta Services Services Orchestra RT\u00c9 Weather Century Ireland RT\u00c9",

By Matt Toledo Norges Bank Investment Management, manager of the Government Pension Fund Global, the sovereign wealth fund of Norway, reported Wednesday a 5.8% return for the third quarter of the year, just 6 basis points below its benchmark. Fund assets rose to 20,440 billion kroner ($2.037 trillion) at the end of September, up 854 billion kroner from the prior quarter. Appreciation of the kroner against other currencies resulted in a 259-billion-kroner decline in the value of the fund. In a statement, Trond Grande, NBIM\u2019s deputy CEO, attributed performance in the quarter to strong equity returns, particularly in the basic materials, telecommunications and financial sectors. For the fund, equities returned 7.7%, fixed income returned 1.4%, unlisted real estate returned 1.1%, and unlisted energy infrastructure returned 0.3%.

The fund has reported an 8.54% annualized return over the past 10 years and an annualized 6.59% return since inception in 1998.

Norges Bank Investment Management's CEO Trond Grande highlighted strong stock market gains in basic materials, telecoms and financials. Equity investments, which make up more than two-thirds of the portfolio, returned 7.7%. Norges Bank Kristian Helgesen/Bloomberg | Bloomberg | Getty Images Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund \u2014 the largest of its kind in the world \u2014 on Wednesday reported a 5.8% return during the third quarter, powered by strong stock market gains and AI optimism. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM) manages the fund on behalf of the Norwegian population. Set up in the 1990s to invest excess revenues from Norway's oil and gas industry, the enormous Government Pension Fund Global is currently invested in assets across 70 countries, including almost 9,000 companies. Its portfolio comprises a mix of equities, fixed income, renewable energy infrastructure and real estate. The return on its equity investments for the quarter was 7.7%, while its fixed income investments made 1.4%. Renewable energy infrastructure added 0.3%, while real estate returned 1.1%. Trond Grande, deputy CEO of Norges Bank Investment Management, said strong stock market gains in basic materials, financials and telecommunications helped drive performance during the quarter. Asia-Pacific was also a key region for the portfolio over the period, Grande told CNBC in an interview Wednesday. He highlighted AI optimism among tech companies, as well as improvements in corporate governance, particularly in Japan and South Korea. Asked by CNBC's Julianna Tatelbaum if there is an AI bubble in markets, Grande said: \"I wouldn't use that word. I think we see elevated pricing, but we also see strong earnings. There's obviously a lot to say for this technology. However, I think the jury is still out on exactly who is going to monetize this new technology in the best way.\" watch now VIDEO 4:58 04:58 The jury is out on race to monetize AI, says NBIM Deputy CEO Squawk Box Europe He added that the fund looked to spread its investments broadly in order to diversify its portfolio. Positive earnings At the end of September, the fund had a value of 20.4 trillion Norwegian kroner ($2 trillion), an increase of 854 billion Norwegian kroner during the the three-month period. The accounting value was 1.03 trillion kroner, translating into a profit of $102.56 billion. The fund's return was 0.06% lower than the benchmark index, NBIM said Wednesday. U.S. stocks account for almost 40% of NBIM's equity investments. Among NBIM's U.S. equity holdings are stakes in tech giants Meta , Alphabet , Amazon , Nvidia and Microsoft . The fund is also a major shareholder in companies including JPMorgan Chase , Walmart , Eli Lilly and Coca Cola . During the reporting period, stock markets were volatile, with the major U.S. averages seeing both selloffs and record highs as Wall Street grappled with U.S. tariffs and looked for clues on the trajectory for the American economy. However, Big Tech stocks largely saw gains over the course of the quarter, as investors continued to bet big on the AI boom. More recently \u2013 and since the NBIM reporting period ended \u2013 volatility has taken hold of tech megacaps, amid growing concerns that an AI bubble is forming in equity markets.

Tesla shareholders approved Musk's $1 trillion pay package contingent on performance. Some large shareholders, including the world's largest wealth fund, had voted against the plan. A Delaware judge had struck down Musk's former pay package of $56 billion. Elon Musk could soon be a trillion-dollar man. On Thursday, 75% of Tesla shareholders voted to approve his proposed $1 trillion pay package as the company's CEO, contingent on a set of performance metrics he would need to meet over the next decade. And based on the standing ovation and exuberant cheering Musk received at the shareholder meeting, Tesla superfans in attendance seemed to love it. \"Howdy, Elon,\" said one attendee during the Q&A portion of the meeting. \"Congrats on not having to show up to work for free anymore.\" The massive compensation package is in hopes that Musk could increase Tesla's market cap by more than sixfold and create a million robots. For comparison, Jensen Huang , the CEO of Nvidia, the world's most valuable company, is expected to receive about $49.9 million in pay in 2025. Ian Keas, managing director of Gallagher's executive compensation consultancy team, told Business Insider that it's rare for a pay package to carry such high stakes. \"Moon shoot incentives have been, for some time, pretty rare,\" said Keas. \"You don't normally see these types of pay packages in US publicly traded companies.\" The question of accountability Musk's pay plan is contingent on Musk achieving several challenging goals. To earn the full $1 trillion, Musk must boost Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035, sell 12 million vehicles a year, and deploy one million robotaxis and one million humanoid robots. Jesse Fried, a professor of law at Harvard Law School, told Business Insider that the decision makes sense due to the \"huge upside to keeping Musk hyper-focused on Tesla.\" \"It was approved by unaffiliated shareholders, who are the parties most affected by the arrangement,\" said Fried. \"I don't believe any other public company has ever voluntarily put CEO pay to a shareholder vote.\" Keas said that when dealing with an executive pay above market rate, there is no significant accountability issue as long as the pay is \"tightly linked\" to \"clear and rigorous\" performance goals with no gray areas. \"When there's an award that's been designed by a board of directors and approved by a shareholder vote, that kind of contract is binding,\" said Keas. \"If the future of the company is successful through proper incentives for a CEO that result in shareholder value appreciation over time, then I don't think shareholders have too much to worry about.\" The new compensation plan follows a Delaware judge's decision that voided Musk's $56 billion compensation deal from 2018, ruling that Tesla's board was unduly influenced by Musk when they agreed to his pay. Tesla relocated its incorporation to Texas and has continued to appeal the decision; it is unclear whether its success or failure would impact Musk's new pay package. Even though Tesla's shares have recovered from the blows they received earlier in the year, their sales face an uncertain future after the end of the EV tax credit . Meanwhile, robotaxis have thus far remained with safe",

Written by Tron Snow Published on November 7, 2025 Share Share the post Share this link via Or copy link Copy Copied The Washington Post / Elon Musk Elon Musk\u2019s heada** behaivor, which has sunk Tesla\u2019s sales, didn\u2019t stop shareholders from making him the world\u2019s first trillionaire. Tesla shareholders approved Phony Stark\u2019s ridiculous pay package that will retain his leadership, fearing they might lose him. Tesla shareholders approved the payout despite his poor job of leading the company since his foray into MAGA politics and his leadership of DOGE, which saw the slashing of government jobs while not saving the country anywhere near the ridiculous amount of money he claimed the temporary agency would. The Verge reports that over 75% of shareholders voted in favor of the proposal. Per The Verge : The vote gives Musk enormous sway over his electric vehicle company, as well as awards him with the largest corporate payout in history. The final tally is expected to be disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in a few days. Musk took the stage at the shareholder meeting in Austin to chants of \u201cElon! Elon!\u201d and flanked by dancing Optimus robots. \u201cWhat we\u2019re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\u201d he said. According to the website, the board first pitched the pay package in September, giving him 423 million additional shares, pushing his stake to about 25 percent, up from 15 percent. Musk Must Meet A Series of Milestones To Get The Full Payout But for Musk to receive full compensation, he would have to meet a series of milestones, which include raising Tesla\u2019s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. He must also get 1 million robotaxis put into service and sell 12 million more cars, 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 1 million humanoid robots. Not all of the shareholders were on board with the idea; Norges Bank Investment Management, one of Tesla\u2019s largest shareholders, voted no. Major proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis also said nah to the pay proposal. We shall see if Musk will be able to hit those achievements because he continues to nosedive in popularity, which only hurts Tesla\u2019s standings as a company. There is also the fact that the Trump administration has done away with the EV credits, another blow to his once budding electric car business. Social media has also been ripping the decision to make Phony Stark a trillionaire; you can see those reactions below. \u2715 Related Tags Elon Musk tesla More from Hip-Hop Wired Donald Trump \"Blowing Bubba\" Reference In Jeffrey Epstein Emails Explained YG, Mozzy, & Jay Rock Put On For The West Coast In New Red Bull Spiral Freestyle DOJ Reveals Blocked Epstein Files Highly Damaging For Trump Katie Got Bandz Nude Pic Leaks; Blames It On a \"Goofy Ass N***a\" [PHOTOS] You May Also Like Sunny Or Grey, They Gon\u2019 Slay!

Despite some opposition from major investors citing concerns over the package's size and dilution, the majority vote signals strong confidence in Musk's vision and commitment to Tesla's ambitious growth targets. AP Despite strong backing from many investors, not all Tesla shareholders supported CEO Elon Musk's pay package. Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved CEO Elon Musk \u2019s staggering $1 trillion pay package, one of the largest in corporate history. Board chair Robyn Denholm urged shareholders to back the deal, warning that failing to secure majority support could jeopardize Tesla\u2019s leadership stability and long-term vision. In a subtle yet firm message, as reported by Fox News, Denholm emphasized Musk\u2019s critical role in the company\u2019s innovation and growth, suggesting that rejecting the compensation plan might risk losing his focus or commitment. ALSO READ: $1000000000000: Elon Musk secures historic pay package as Tesla shareholders approve plan that could make him the world\u2019s first trillionaire According to Fox News, the shareholders overwhelmingly backed the record-setting compensation plan, with about 75% voting in favor of its approval at the company\u2019s annual meeting. According to AFP, the announcement of the vote results sparked loud cheers of 'Elon' from the crowd gathered at Tesla\u2019s factory in Austin, Texas. The revised compensation plan comes as legal uncertainty continues over Musk\u2019s earlier $56 billion pay package from 2018, which a Delaware judge invalidated in January 2024. That ruling, currently under appeal, has left Tesla navigating ongoing litigation while seeking shareholder approval for a new structure to reaffirm Musk\u2019s compensation and leadership role. \"I'd like to just give a heartfelt thanks to everyone who supported the shareholder votes,\" an elated Musk said after the approval. \"I super-appreciate it.\" Live Events ALSO READ: Elon Musk's historic $1 trillion pay package: Tesla CEO's net worth to exceed GDP of seven countries?

The contrast highlights America\u2019s wealth divide \u2014 Musk\u2019s soaring rewards versus public anger over inequality and calls for fairer distribution of prosperity. Listen to this article in summarized format Listen NYT News Service FILE -- Elon Musk, Tesla's chief executive, on Capitol Hill in Washington, March 5, 2025. Tesla shareholders on Thursday, Nov. 6, approved a plan to grant. Musk shares worth nearly $1 trillion if he meets ambitious goals, including vastly expanding the company's stock market valuation. (Maansi Srivastava/The New York Times) Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a plan that could make Elon Musk the world's first trillionaire, two days after New Yorkers elected a tax-the-rich candidate as their next mayor. These discrete moments offered strikingly different lessons about America and who deserves how much of its wealth. At Tesla, based in the Austin, Texas, area, shareholders have largely bought into a winner-takes-all version of capitalism, agreeing by a wide margin to give Musk shares worth almost $1 trillion if the company under his management achieves ambitious financial and operational goals over the next decade. But halfway across the country, in the home to Wall Street, Zohran Mamdani's victory served as a reminder of the frustrations many Americans have with an economic system that has left them struggling to afford basics like food, housing and child care. These are vastly different arenas, to be sure. But that split-screen reality speaks to a larger divide in American business and politics. On one side are billionaires like Musk and their many supporters, including President Donald Trump, who see the financial success of a small group of executives as something to be celebrated and emulated. On the other are progressives like Mamdani, a democratic socialist, who are calling for something more akin to the social welfare systems of Western Europe. Mamdani campaigned on using higher taxes on businesses and the wealthy to pay for universal child care and free buses -- promises that helped him win a resounding victory against two more conservative candidates. Much like an earlier pay plan that Tesla shareholders approved in 2018, this 12-step package asks Musk, the company's CEO, to vastly expand Tesla's stock market valuation -- to $8.5 trillion from around $1.4 trillion -- while hitting a variety of other goals. Those include selling 1 million robots with humanlike qualities and 10 million paid subscriptions to the company's self-driving software. \"What we're about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\" Musk said after thanking shareholders for their support. Tesla's directors and some investors, including the board that oversees Florida's public pension fund, hailed the $1 trillion pay plan as a way to motivate Musk, who is already the world's wealthiest person, to build futuristic products like cars that can drive themselves. \"Those who claim the plan is 'too large' ignore the scale of ambition that has historically defined Tesla's trajectory,\" the Florida State Board of Administration said in a securities filing describing why it voted for Musk's pay plan. \"A company that went from near bankruptcy to global leadership in EVs and clean energy under similar frameworks has earned the right to use incentive models that reward moonshot performance.\" The plan is structured in such a way that if Musk makes money, the company's investors do, too -- a point that fund manager Cathie Wood made this week on Musk's social media platform X. \"I do not understand why investors are voting against Elon's pay package when they and their clients would benefit enormously if he and his incredible team meet such high goals,\" Wood, who is the CEO of Ark Invest, wrote.

During Tesla\u2019s annual general meeting today, when it was announced that 75% of investors had given the thumbs up to the future paycheck for Musk (pictured), the audience broke out in raucous applause. Though the announcement has met with criticism in some quarters, the board has said it couldn\u2019t afford for Musk to leave the company. Not all investors gave their approval of the package, but it appears most believe that Musk will deliver in a world that will soon be dominated by robotics and artificial intelligence. What the board wants to achieve is somewhat ambitious: It would like to see Tesla\u2019s current $1.4 trillion market value increase to $8.5 trillion over the next decade. As his discussion with podcaster Joe Rogan recently outlined, Musk is hoping the future will feature omnipresent Tesla robotaxis . He even hinted at a flying car, soon to be unveiled, although it\u2019s highly unlikely that flying cars will become consumer items anytime soon. More realistically, Tesla hopes to have 10 million paid subscribers to the company\u2019s self-driving software . The company\u2019s Optimus robot, which Musk also sees as Tesla\u2019s future, has just gone into mass production. Soon after the announcement, Musk took to the stage as his name was chanted. \u201cWhat we\u2019re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\u201d he told the crowd. \u201cOther shareholder meetings are snoozefests, but ours are bangers. Look at this. This is sick,\u201d he added. For many Americans, \u201csick\u201d might take on another meaning. The deal comes as economic inequality reaches new highs in the U.S., where more and more Americans are venting their frustrations with the cost of living and the expanding wealth gap. Still, for those who voted for the package, Musk is the key to future success. \u201cThose who claim the plan is \u2018too large\u2019 ignore the scale of ambition that has historically defined Tesla\u2019s trajectory,\u201d the Florida State Board of Administration said in a securities filing, explaining the reason for support of the plan. \u201cA company that went from near bankruptcy to global leadership in EVs and clean energy under similar frameworks has earned the right to use incentive models that reward moonshot performance.\u201d Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood wrote on X that she didn\u2019t understand why some investors were against the plan. \u201cI do not understand why investors are voting against Elon\u2019s pay package when they and their clients would benefit enormously if he and his incredible team meet such high goals,\u201d she said Norwegian firm Norges Bank Investment Management, Tesla\u2019s sixth-largest outside investor, explained why it wasn\u2019t keen on the deal: \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk \u2014 consistent with our views on executive compensation.\u201d Tesla sales have dropped off considerably in Norway, while some investors may feel uncertain about Musk\u2019s alliance with President Trump and the fact that his public-facing personality is polarizing and could potentially upset Tesla\u2019s bottom line.

Musk hailed the outcome as a turning point for Tesla\u2019s future. \u201cWhat we\u2019re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla but a whole new book,\u201d Musk said, as The New York Times reported.

Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management \u2014 one of Tesla\u2019s largest shareholders \u2014 broke ranks, however, and voted against the pay plan, saying that the package was excessive. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,\u201d the firm said . The vote comes months after Musk wrapped up his short-lived government role under President Donald Trump. In February, Musk and his Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) team sparked a firestorm when they announced plans to eliminate the U.S. Agency for International Development, drawing backlash from Democrats and prompting protests targeting Musk and his companies, including Tesla. Back in May, Musk announced that his \u201cscheduled time\u201d leading DOGE had ended.

Got it Normal text size Larger text size Very large text size Advertisement Tesla shareholders approved a $US1 trillion ($1.5 trillion) compensation package for chief executive officer Elon Musk, the largest payout ever awarded to a corporate leader. More than 75 per cent of votes were cast in favour of the unprecedented pay plan, the company said on Thursday at its annual meeting. The outcome caps a weeks-long campaign by the electric vehicle maker\u2019s board, its CEO and prominent retail investors to build support. Tesla boss Elon Musk speaks to shareholders at the meeting in Austin, Texas. Musk took to the stage in Austin, Texas, along with dancing robots, and thanked shareholders for their support. \u201cI super appreciate it,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we are about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book. This really is going to be quite the story.\u201d The pay agreement clears a path for Musk, the world\u2019s richest person, to become the first-ever trillionaire and expand his stake in Tesla to 25 per cent or more over the next decade. To achieve the full payout, he\u2019ll have to deliver on targets to significantly expand Tesla\u2019s market value, revive its flagging car business and get the fledgling robotaxi and robotics efforts off the ground. Loading The compensation vote was pivotal for Tesla, after Musk suggested he could step down or spend more time with his other companies if he didn\u2019t get greater control over the carmaker. He\u2019s now likely to remain at the helm as Tesla pursues an ambitious agenda built around driverless vehicles and artificial intelligence. Tesla shares were little changed at 5.15pm in post-market trading Thursday in New York, paring an earlier gain of as much as 3.4 per cent. The stock was up 14 per cent this year through Wednesday\u2019s close, narrowly trailing the 16 per cent advance in the S&P 500 Index. Advertisement The package was widely expected to pass, even after several prominent investors came out in opposition, including Norway\u2019s Norges Bank Investment Management, Tesla\u2019s ninth-largest holder. Proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis recommended investors reject the compensation plan, citing concerns with its magnitude and its potential to dilute other shareholders\u2019 ownership. The board waged an aggressive effort to garner support, featuring meetings with large institutional shareholders and a series of media appearances by chair Robyn Denholm. In interviews with Bloomberg News, Denholm cast the vote as crucial to Tesla\u2019s future, which needs an engaged Musk to achieve it",

Off On Stream on Elon Musk awarded nearly $1 trillion pay package by Tesla shareholders Musk would become the best-compensated CEO ever. By Max Zahn November 6, 2025, 4:59 PM 1:31 Tesla co-founder and CEO Elon Musk gestures while introducing the newly unveiled all-electric battery-powered Tesla Cybertruck at Tesla Design Center in Hawthorne, Calif., Nov. 21, 2019. Frederic J. Brown/AFP via Getty Images Tesla shareholders awarded CEO Elon Musk a pay package on Thursday that could grant the tech entrepreneur nearly $1 trillion in compensation over the next decade. The pay package would make Musk the best-compensated CEO ever recorded. According to a securities filing in September, Musk would rake in roughly $900 billion over the duration of the agreement. Approval of the compensation package received more than 75% of the shareholder vote, Tesla General Counsel Brandon Erhart said during the shareholder meeting on Thursday. Tariffs have been Donald Trump's personal crusade. Now, a Supreme Court test The full compensation would only be delivered if Musk vaults the company from its present value of $1.1 trillion to $8.5 trillion, a figure that exceeds the current combined market values of Meta, Microsoft and Google-parent Alphabet, the filing says. The compensation package also includes a set of production goals, including one million Robotaxis in commercial operation and the delivery of one million humanoid robots over the next 10 years, according to the securities filing. Before Tesla released the results of the shareholder vote, some major shareholders said they had voted down the proposal. Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund said Tuesday that it had voted against the pay package, raising concerns about its scale and potential risks. \"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" Norges Bank Investment Management, the manager of the fund, said in a statement. Musk, considered the world's richest person, currently boasts a net worth of about $504 billion, according to Forbes . If he were to receive the full pay package, Musk would become the world's first-ever trillionaire. The pay package could also increase Musk's ownership stake in Tesla to as much as 29%. Musk has long pursued a larger ownership stake. \u201cWe are at a pivotal juncture in Tesla\u2019s history, and the proposals the Special Committee has carefully designed and the Board has put forward will help determine Tesla\u2019s future,\u201d the company\u2019s website said earlier this week. \u201cIf you believe, like us, that Elon is the CEO that can make our ambitious vision a reality, vote NOW.\u201d Online voting among shareholders closed at 11:59 a.m. ET on Wednesday.

Last year, a Delaware judge twice struck down a $50 billion pay package for Musk put forward by the company in 2018. An aerial view of Tesla Shanghai Gigafactory, March 29, 2021, in Shanghai, China. Xiaolu Chu/Getty Images Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, which litigates corporate governance litigation for companies incorporated in Delaware, initially declared that the negotiations surrounding the package had been inappropriate, due to a lack of independence among board members and problematic influence by Musk over those negotiations. In a second ruling, McCormick decided that an additional shareholder vote on the compensation package -- even if made with full knowledge of the initial problems surrounding the negotiation of the agreement -- could not undo those problems. Musk has appealed the ruling. Tesla announced a 12% jump in revenue over the third quarter in October, snapping a streak of two consecutive quarters of falling sales. Still, earnings fell short of analysts\u2019 expectations, causing a drop in the stock price. Overall, shares of Tesla have climbed about 16% this year, putting them roughly in line with a jump in the S & P 500 over that period.

Kevin Dietsch/Getty Images It\u2019s official: Elon Musk is on track to become the world\u2019s first trillionaire. Recommended Video Tesla shareholders approved a new executive pay package Thursday afternoon that would give Musk nearly $1 trillion in stock over the next decade, a record-shattering deal for the world\u2019s richest man. The total award depends on whether Musk can meet ambitious performance targets for the struggling electric-vehicle company , including growing Tesla\u2019s market cap to $8.5 trillion\u2014a more than 500% increase from today\u2019s valuation. The goals also include delivery of 20 million Tesla vehicles and 1 million bots in addition to 1 million robotaxis in commercial operation. \u201cWhile we believe Elon is the only person capable of leading Tesla at this critical inflection point, changing the world is neither an overnight process nor the work of a single person,\u201d Tesla\u2019s Board wrote in a letter to shareholders in August. \u201cSo, we also want your help in securing the team and strategy needed to achieve goals that others will perceive as impossible but that we know are possible for Tesla.\u201d Musk\u2019s net worth is estimated at about $473 billion. Reining Musk back in If all goes to plan, Musk\u2019s stake in Tesla will rise from about 13% to nearly 29%\u2014a level of control he\u2019s long sought. Having voting control in the \u201cmid-20s\u201d percent range would help secure a \u201cstrong influence,\u201d but gives shareholders enough control to fire him if he goes \u201cinsane,\u201d Musk said during Tesla\u2019s earnings call last month. \u201cIt\u2019s called compensation, but it\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to go spend the money,\u201d Musk added. \u201cIt\u2019s just, if we build this robot army, do I have at least a strong influence over that robot army, not current control, but a strong influence? That\u2019s what it comes down to in a nutshell. I don\u2019t feel comfortable wielding that robot army if I don\u2019t have at least a strong influence.\u201d Tesla\u2019s stock fell as much as 43% between January and March as Musk devoted much of his time to leading the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Since stepping back, shares have recovered to being up 16% year-to-date. Many shareholders hope the new incentives will keep Musk focused on Tesla. Ron Baron, the founder and CEO of Baron Capital, which holds a 0.39% stake in Tesla, said in a post on X that he supported the plan because without Musk, Tesla wouldn\u2019t exist. \u201cElon is the ultimate \u2018key man\u2019 of key man risk,\u201d Baron wrote. \u201cWithout his relentless drive and uncompromising standards, there would be no Tesla.\u201d From Pope Leo to Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, Musk\u2019s pay package had its haters Not every Tesla investor was on board with the extravagant deal. Glass Lewis and ISS, two proxy advisory services, urged Tesla shareholders to vote against the proposal, with the latter group citing \u201cunmitigated concerns\u201d with its magnitude and design. Musk then fired back during Tesla\u2019s October earnings call, calling them \u201ccorporate terrorists.\u201d Meanwhile, Norges Bank Investment Management, the group behind Norway\u2019s $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund which holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla, said it voted against the pay package. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk \u2014 consistent with our views on executive compensation,\u201d the group said in a statement this week. Pope Leo XIV , though not a Tesla investor, also recently expressed his concern for the message sent by Musk becoming a trillionaire\u2014and the growing divide between the rich and the poor. \u201cCEOs that 60 years ago might have been making four to six times more than what the workers are receiving, the last figure I saw, it\u2019s 600 times more than what average workers are receiving,\u201d the pontiff told Catholic news site Crux in an interview released in September. \u201cYesterday, the news that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world: What does that mean and what\u2019s that about? If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we\u2019re in big trouble.\u201d A recent report from Oxfam found that the 10 richest Americans\u2014which include Musk as well as Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison, Amazon cofounder Jeff Bezos, and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg\u2014gained $69.8 billion over the past year.

Elon Musk could become trillionaire with new Tesla pay package 02:45 Get more news Live on Nov. 6, 2025, 5:01 PM EST By David Ingram Tesla announced Thursday that shareholders had voted to approve the biggest pay package in corporate history for CEO Elon Musk, in a deal worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years if the company meets a list of benchmarks such as selling 1 million humanoid robots. Over 75% of shareholders voted in favor of the pay package, said Brandon Ehrhart, the company\u2019s general counsel, as Tesla shareholders gathered in person and virtually for their annual meeting. After the announcement, Musk celebrated the vote on a stage at the shareholder meeting, dancing and laughing alongside a pair of robots. \u201cI super appreciate it. Thank you, everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we\u2019re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter on the future of Tesla but a whole new book.\u201d Musk is already the world\u2019s wealthiest person, with a net worth of about $473 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index . The compensation agreement could help to make him the world\u2019s first member of the \u201cFour Comma Club\u201d with $1 trillion or more in riches. Musk\u2019s wealth has risen this year despite serious damage to Tesla\u2019s brand among politically left-leaning consumers caused by his embrace of right-wing politics around the world and his work in the Department of Government Efficiency in the Trump administration. In the first half of the year, Tesla suffered from falling revenue as anti-Musk protesters picketed Tesla showrooms to denounce his role in slashing foreign aid and other government spending. Now, Musk is trying to turn around the company\u2019s fortunes by focusing on developing robots that could one day work as household servants and by deploying robotaxis that could potentially drive without people in control. Neither is a reality yet: Tesla isn\u2019t taking orders for droids, and its robotaxi prototypes still have employees in the vehicles for safety. In recent weeks, Musk\u2019s fan base \u2014 which ranges from small retail shareholders to some prominent Silicon Valley investors \u2014 has been vocal on his social media app X in favor of the pay package, arguing that he gets nothing unless he makes the company more valuable. On a website urging \u201cyes\u201d votes , Tesla\u2019s investor relations department said the pay package was \u201cdesigned to keep Elon\u2019s time, energy and considerable talents focused on Tesla for years to come and create jaw-dropping value for our shareholders.\u201d Musk would need to remain Tesla CEO for 7\u00bd years in order to vest in any shares from the new pay package, according to the agreement\u2019s terms , although he may continue in his other CEO roles at rocket company SpaceX and artificial intelligence startup xAI. The proposal resulted in some opposition, including from Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund , which noted that Musk\u2019s new shares would dilute existing shares . \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk- consistent with our views on executive compensation,\u201d the fund\u2019s manager, Norges Bank Investment Management, said in a statement. The pay package was expected to be approved, with odds of passage at 93% on the betting website Polymarket on Wednesday. Musk has said that the pay package is more about him maintaining control over Tesla and its products than about riches. \u201cIf I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just",

Hawkins is transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State. Tesla shareholders voted Thursday to approve Elon Musk\u2019s staggering new pay package , in a move aimed at retaining the controversial CEO\u2019s leadership during a time of great upheaval for the automaker. Over 75 percent of shares voted in favor of the proposal. The vote gives Musk enormous sway over his electric vehicle company, as well as awards him with the largest corporate payout in history. The final tally is expected to be disclosed in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing in a few days. Musk took the stage at the shareholder meeting in Austin to chants of \u201cElon! Elon!\u201d and flanked by dancing Optimus robots. \u201cWhat we\u2019re about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\u201d he said. The proposed pay package, which was put forward by the board last September , would award Musk more than 423 million additional shares, increasing his stake to about 25 percent from its current level of 15 percent. In order to receive the full compensation, Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla\u2019s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. Musk must also put into service 1 million robotaxis and sell 12 million more cars, 10 million Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and 1 million humanoid robots. In the run-up to the vote, Tesla warned shareholders that a failure to approve the enormous payout would risk losing Musk to other endeavors. The compensation package is aimed at luring him back to the EV company, even though Musk seems more motivated by the idea of creating \u2014 and controlling \u2014 a \u201crobot army.\u201d Musk would need to achieve a series of milestones, including raising Tesla\u2019s market capitalization from its current $1.5 trillion to $8.5 trillion in 10 years. The vote was opposed by some of Tesla\u2019s largest shareholders, including Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, as well as some smaller public pension funds, such as the American Federation of Teachers and various New York City retirement systems. Major proxy advisory firms Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis have also come out against the pay proposal. Musk\u2019s current compensation package, valued at more than $50 billion, was invalidated by a Delaware court last year after a judge found that Tesla\u2019s board lacked sufficient independence from the billionaire CEO. Shareholders had voted twice to approve the hefty compensation",

Updated 2025-11-06T23:43:22.979Z Elon Musk just scored a pay package that could make him the world's first trillionaire. Now comes the hard part \u2014 achieving 12 ambitious milestones. With over 75% of the votes cast in favor, Tesla shareholders on Thursday approved a compensation plan worth up to $1 trillion, capping a yearslong saga over Musk's pay. A vote on whether to authorize a Tesla investment into xAI , Musk's AI startup, was less conclusive. Tesla said that while a majority of participating shareholders voted to approve an investment into xAI, there was also a \"significant number of abstentions.\" Tesla said the board will examine the \"next steps.\" Tesla investors voted on multiple proposals. Chief among them was Musk's pay package, which is contingent on achieving some lofty goals. To earn the full $1 trillion value, Musk must boost Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion by 2035, sell 12 million vehicles a year, and deploy one million robotaxis and one million humanoid robots. Tesla's shares jumped 3% after hours following the voting results, but dipped into the red during Musk's address to the audience, where he talked about the challenges of Optimus production and teased a new Tesla Roadster demo on April 1 of next year. It was slightly up after hours as the meeting ended. Musk also told the audience that it's \"probably worth having talks with Intel,\" though he said Tesla hasn't signed any deal with the chipmaker. Intel's stock price jumped 3% after hours following the remark. Tesla is \"probably\" going to have to build a \"gigantic chip fab\" to the volume of chips the company needs, the CEO added. \"Gotta be done,\" Musk said. \"I'm super hardcore on chips right now, as you can tell,\" Musk said. The pay package proposal proved divisive in the run-up to the meeting. Weeks ahead of the vote, proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have both urged shareholders to reject the proposal. Musk called the proxy firms \"corporate terrorists\" during Tesla's recent earnings call . Scroll on for the play-by-play of Tesla's annual shareholder meeting and Musk's remarks.

Tesla shareholders set to vote on Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay package on November 6 Tesla shareholders will vote on a massive pay package for Elon Musk, potentially worth $1 trillion, aimed at retaining him for technological advancements. Written By Riya R Alex Published 6 Nov 2025, 01:32 PM IST Tesla shareholders will vote Elon Musk's pay package on November 6. ( via REUTERS ) Tesla shareholders will vote on Thursday on the fate of a massive pay package intended to retain Elon Musk long enough to achieve technological breakthroughs he vows will change the world. Musk, who has claimed that Tesla's engineering expertise in artificial intelligence, autonomy, and robotics will surpass rival tech giants, stands to receive as much as $1 trillion in an unprecedented package linked to performance targets. Tesla Chair Robin Denholm has appeared on CNBC and other broadcasts in recent weeks to promote the plan, demonstrating the board's continued enthusiastic support for Musk, despite criticism that the billionaire's alignment with far-right political figures has affected sales. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labour,\" AFP quoted Denholm's message on October 27. Musk has suggested that he might leave Tesla or step back if his ownership stake isn't increased to grant him the level of influence he wants over the company's future. The package could increase Musk's stake to over 25 percent of Tesla shares from its current level of more than 12 percent. \"It's not like I'm going to spend the money,\" Musk said on a conference call in October. \u201cIt's just if we build this robot army, (I want to) have at least a strong influence over that robot army.\u201d The vote result will be announced at Tesla's annual shareholder meeting held at the Austin, Texas factory on Thursday.

The board strongly backs the plan, arguing Musk's departure could significantly devalue the company. Critics, however, decry the package's immense size and Musk's political associations. AP Elon Musk Tesla shareholders will determine on Thursday the fate of a massive pay package meant to retain Elon Musk long enough to achieve technological breakthroughs he vows will change the world. Musk -- who has boasted that Tesla's engineering prowess in artificial intelligence, autonomy and robotics will leave rival tech giants in the dust -- stands to garner as much as $1 trillion in an unprecedented package tied to performance benchmarks. Tesla Chair Robin Denholm has appeared on CNBC and other broadcasts in recent weeks to sell the plan in a sign of the board's continued enthusiastic backing for Musk, despite criticism that the billionaire's embrace of far-right political figures has weighed on sales. \"Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor,\" Denholm said in an October 27 message to shareholders. Musk himself has hinted he could leave Tesla or take a back seat if his ownership share is not raised enough to give him the influence over its future that he desires. Live Events The package could lift Musk's holding to more than 25 percent of Tesla shares from its current level of more than 12 percent. \"It's not like I'm going to spend the money,\" Musk said on a conference call in October. \"It's just if we build this robot army, (I want to) have at least a strong influence over that robot army.\" The outcome of the vote will be announced at the annual shareholder meeting at Tesla's factory in Austin, Texas, on Thursday. Anti-Musk protesters plan a demonstration outside the Tesla gigafactory that day, after an anti-Musk rally in downtown Austin on Wednesday. \"A trillion dollars is way too much any person should have under any circumstances,\" activist Ethan McBride told AFP, calling the package a means of \"enriching the man who is funding degradation of our democracy.\" Norway fund says no Musk, witha net worth of more than $500 billion, is already the world's richest person, according to Forbes' real-time list of billionaires. He must hit 12 milestones related to market capitalization to receive the full pay package. The first tranche would be available if and when Tesla reaches $2 trillion in market value. The plan also involves a series of operating profit and product goals, such as the delivery of 20 million Tesla vehicles. The package aims to ensure Musk stays at Tesla for at least seven-and-a-half years. Musk has described Tesla's potential growth as nearly boundless, saying in July that \"Tesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far\" if the company delivers on its vision for autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. Musk's success in growing Tesla, SpaceX and other ventures has inspired many believers. However, skeptics have complained that the company has been slow to introduce new models and that Musk has a penchant for pushing ba",

The package could lift Musk\u2019s holding to more than 25 percent of Tesla shares from its current level of more than 12 percent. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m going to spend the money,\u201d Musk said on a conference call in October. \u201cIt\u2019s just if we build this robot army, (I want to) have at least a strong influence over that robot army.\u201d The outcome of the vote will be announced at the annual shareholder meeting at Tesla\u2019s factory in Austin, Texas, on Thursday. Anti-Musk protesters plan a demonstration outside the Tesla gigafactory that day, after an anti-Musk rally in downtown Austin on Wednesday. \u201cA trillion dollars is way too much any person should have under any circumstances,\u201d activist Ethan McBride told AFP, calling the package a means of \u201cenriching the man who is funding degradation of our democracy.\u201d \u2013 Norway fund says no \u2013 Musk, with a net worth of more than $500 billion, is already the world\u2019s richest person, according to Forbes\u2019 real-time list of billionaires. He must hit 12 milestones related to market capitalization to receive the full pay package. The first tranche would be available if and when Tesla reaches $2 trillion in market value. The plan also involves a series of operating profit and product goals, such as the delivery of 20 million Tesla vehicles. The package aims to ensure Musk stays at Tesla for at least seven-and-a-half years. Musk has described Tesla\u2019s potential growth as nearly boundless, saying in July that \u201cTesla will be the most valuable company in the world by far\u201d if the company delivers on its vision for autonomous driving and artificial intelligence. Musk\u2019s success in growing Tesla, SpaceX and other ventures has inspired many believers. However, skeptics have complained that the company has been slow to introduce new models and that Musk has a penchant for pushing back or not delivering on targets that sound difficult if not impossible. The pay proposal has been panned by Glass Lewis and Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS), advisory firms Musk has referred to as \u201ccorporate terrorists.\u201d An October 17 ISS analysis of the proposal criticized the rationale for the potential windfall, noting that Musk\u2019s financial interests are already closely tied to Tesla\u2019s fate. As structured, the separation of the overall package into tranches of \u201cunprecedented\u201d value \u201ccould undermine the necessity for all goals to be realized,\u201d said ISS, which also flagged the lack of explicit requirements that the busy Musk keep focused on Tesla. Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, one of Tesla\u2019s 10 largest shareholders, said this week it was voting no. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk \u2014 consistent with our views on executive compensation,\u201d Norges Bank Investment Management said on its website. Others voting against the proposal include New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli. Florida state officials have endorsed the plan, noting Musk\u2019s record of creating equity value and",

Critics warn the plan gives Musk excessive power and ignores governance norms, while investors face a tough choice between loyalty and financial risk. Agencies Tesla 's board of directors has pushed in all its chips on Elon Musk . Now investors must decide whether to back the biggest bet in company history. Shareholders will vote Thursday on the stark choice presented by the board: pay Musk up to $878 billion in company stock or take the risk he will leave - potentially driving down the company's stock. The decision, experts say, amounts to a referendum on whether traditional corporate-governance rules apply to the world's richest man. The board and many investors argue that only Musk can deliver on his promises to transform Tesla into an artificial-intelligence juggernaut delivering millions of self-driving robotaxis and humanoid robots. If Musk hits all the board's performance goals within a decade, Tesla's market value will have grown to $8.5 trillion - with Musk owning about a quarter of the stock. That is exponentially more compensation than any other CEO, and Musk would still collect record payouts - tens of billions - if he misses most performance goals. Many investors are not blinking at the eye-watering sums. \"If the stock is going to go up sixfold - and that's a requirement here - then I'm going to make a lot of money,\" said Nancy Tengler, CEO and chief investment officer of Laffer Tengler Investments, a Tesla investor. \"Why do I care what kind of money he makes if he's effecting the change and the vision?\" Other major shareholders and executive-pay experts warn that the proposal represents an enormous risk to investors. The package, experts said, flouts governance principles not only because of its size but because the board is so explicitly staking Tesla's future on one leader, with myriad conflicts of interest, who stands to consolidate unchecked power over the company. Responsible governance, they argue, requires boards to remain open to a competitive market for the best available CEO at any given time. Musk did not respond to requests for comment. A spokesperson for Tesla's board declined to comment. Musk told board members during negotiations that he might prioritize his many other ventures - including rocket firm SpaceX, artificial-intelligence startup xAI and brain-implant firm Neuralink - unless they came to terms. And board chair Robyn Denholm has repeatedly emphasized the risk of losing Musk in selling shareholders on his compensation. Charles Elson, founding director of the Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance at the University of Delaware , said Tesla's board is being \"held over the barrel by a 'superstar CEO.'\" \"To me the appropriate answer is to say, 'Have a good day,'\" Elson said. Major shareholders including the biggest U.S. public pension fund, the California Public Employees' Retirement System (CalPERS), and Norway's sovereign wealth fund echoed those concerns in publicly opposing Musk's compensation. Norges Bank Investment Management said on Tuesday the pay proposal could dilute shareholder value and failed to mitigate the \"key person risk\" in staking Tesla's future on Musk. The board sought to ensure Musk's longevity in company leadership with provisions including stock vesting periods. Krishna Palepu, a professor at Harvard Business School focusing on corporate governance, said the proposal aligns with shareholders' interests by tying Musk's compensation to large stock-value increases and requiring him to hold the shares he earns for five years. Musk, he said, has a track record of achieving extraordinary stock-price growth and would receive the largest payouts only if he does it again. \"The numbers are big because the goals are big,\" Palepu said. The leverage of bold promises Musk's leverage over the board and shareholde",

By Will Gottsegen Justin Sullivan / Getty November 4, 2025 Share Save Listen \u2212 1.0 x + 0:00 6:49 Listen to more stories on the Noa app. This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here. Elon Musk wants to be anointed the world\u2019s first trillionaire\u2014but he swears it\u2019s not about the money. Over the past few weeks, the Tesla CEO has been demanding greater power over the electric-vehicle manufacturer that he has led for almost two decades. Specifically, he is asking for another 12 percent of the company\u2014a stake currently worth roughly $190 billion. If shareholders vote for it, and if Musk meets the board\u2019s goals for drastically increasing the company\u2019s value, the total value of his personal stake will shoot up to $1 trillion. At Tesla\u2019s annual meeting on Thursday, shareholders will finish voting on whether to give him both more money and more control over the company\u2019s governance\u2014or to give him neither. The compensation package is partly a reflection of Tesla\u2019s changing priorities. The company\u2019s \u201c Master Plan IV ,\u201d released in September, \u201cmakes no mention of any new electric cars in the works,\u201d Patrick George recently wrote in The Atlantic . \u201cIt is instead a technocratic fever dream, predicting a future in which humanoid robots made by Tesla free us from mundane tasks and create a utopia of \u2018sustainable abundance.\u2019\u201d Tesla\u2019s board has said that the compensation package will help motivate Musk to pursue these innovations; in the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call last month, robots\u2014not money\u2014were at the heart of Musk\u2019s argument for more shares. \u201cIf I go ahead and build this enormous robot army, can I just be ousted at some point in the future?\u201d he asked. As the world\u2019s richest man and the CEO of several companies, Musk exerts an enormous amount of influence over many people\u2019s lives, but Tesla\u2019s structure does include some checks on that power. Tesla is, on paper, overseen by those who actually own the company\u2014which isn\u2019t always the case at other public companies. Mark Zuckerberg, for example, owns about 13 percent of Meta, but as of last year, he controls 61 percent of the total voting power, thanks to a special class of stock that grants him outsize sway over corporate governance. This system is not a democratic representation of all shareholders\u2019 views, but it is nevertheless popular among today\u2019s tech companies. Snap Inc. (the parent company of Snapchat) is perhaps the most extreme example; its two co-founders control more than 99 percent of the vote. The fact that a vote against Tesla\u2019s pay package is even technically possible is a reflection of a not-so-monopolized voting structure. Companies often have valid reasons for deciding to centralize so much control in the hands of a few individuals (dissenters can make it hard for boardrooms to move quickly on decisions, and outside interests can dilute a founder\u2019s vision, to name two). But that centralization can also lead to something of a shareholder monarchy. Although Tesla is already consolidated around Musk, he still doesn\u2019t own a majority of the company. If shareholders were to reject his pay package, they\u2019d be reminding the board that, for now, they still have ultimate say over how the company is run. Analysts generally believe that the compensation package will be accepted, because top Tesla shareholders have been content to follow Musk\u2019s lead in the past. The company\u2019s structure should ideally enable a multiplicity of dissenting voices\u2014but more often, shareholders are simply willing to go with the board\u2019s recommendations. This time, however, there has been early and forceful pushback. Some shareholders , including Norges Bank Investment Management, the bank behind the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund, have come out against the plan on the grounds that $1 trillion is simply too much money for a single CEO. Prominent public figures have weighed in too: \u201cWe\u2019re in big trouble,\u201d Pope Leo XIV said of Musk\u2019s possibly becoming a trillionaire. But in the world of corporate governance, there are forces far more influen",

The controversial proposal , which is scheduled to be considered at Tesla\u2019s annual meeting in Texas, would hand Musk an unprecedented payout tied to a series of performance benchmarks. Critics \u2013 including key proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis and even Pope Leo XIV \u2013 argue the proposed salary is excessive. Meanwhile, Tesla chairwoman Robyn Denholm and Musk himself have warned that he could leave the company entirely if shareholders reject the proposal. \u201cTesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns,\u201d Denholm said in a recent letter posted on X. 3 Tesla shareholders will vote on a nearly $1 trillion pay package for Musk. REUTERS Musk has framed the vote in near-apocalyptic terms \u2013 declaring in an Oct. 29 X post that \u201ccontrol of Tesla could affect the future of civilization.\u201d Explore More Beloved steakhouse chain making comeback with refreshed rebranding Ford CEO laments he can\u2019t fill 5,000 mechanic jobs paying $120K per year Social Security benefits could increase by $200 a month \u2014 here's who would qualify The billionaire has argued that he needs greater voting control offered by the stock grants in order to effectively guide Tesla\u2019s future plans for artificial intelligence, which include the robots and full self-driving technology. Musk would control nearly 29% of voting shares if he hits all targets. The jaw-dropping pay package, unveiled in a September proxy filing, was crafted by Tesla\u2019s board after a Delaware judge struck down a previous $56 billion compensation plan for Musk. The judge ruled that the previous package, which was approved in 2018, was excessive and riddled with conflicts of interest. Under the latest proposal, one tranche of Musk\u2019s pay would be awarded if Tesla hits a $2 trillion valuation and delivers 20 million vehicles. Another would kick in if Tesla is valued at $3 trillion and delivers 1 million of its \u201cOptimus\u201d humanoid robots. The new pay package drew a major rebuke this week from Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund, which became the largest Tesla stakeholder to say it opposed the plan. 3 Tesla\u2019s board has warned Elon Musk could leave if the package is rejected. REUTERS \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk,\u201d stated Norges Bank Investment Management, which oversees the sovereign wealth fund. Tesla shares were down nearly 5% in Tuesday\u2019s trading. Pope Leo XIV previously cited Musk\u2019s pay package as an example of the loss of \u201cthe value of human life, of the family, of the value of society.\u201d \u201cYesterday, the news [arrived] that Elon Musk is going to be the first trillionaire in the world,\u201d Leo told Catholic news outlet Crux in an interview published in September. \u201cWhat does that mean, and what\u2019s that about?\u201d the pontiff continued. \u201cIf that is the only thing that has any value any more, then we are in big trouble.\u201d ISS and Glass Lewis have also recommended that shareholders say no, asserting that the pay is excessive and could dilute the holdings of other investors. 3 A person sits in a Tesla Cybercab outside the Nasdaq Market site in New York City, U.S., October 27, 2025. REUTERS Tesla\u2019s largest individual investors, including BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard, have yet to reveal how they plan to vote. Despite the lingering uncertainty, Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said he expects shareholders to give a \u201cbright green light\u201d to the plan. \u201cWith the AI Revolution this is a crucial time for Tesla ahead with autonomous and robotics front and center,\u201d Ives said in a note to clients on Monday. \u201cWe expect shareholders to show overwhelming support for Musk and the xAI stake further ",

The fund, which is managed by Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), holds a 1.14% stake in Tesla valued at about $11.7 billion, according to its mid-year filings in June. \u201cWhile we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk\u2019s visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk \u2014 consistent with our views on executive compensation,\u201d the fund said in a statement posted on its website . \u201cWe will continue to seek constructive dialogue with Tesla on this and other topics.\u201d NBIM\u2019s rejection may not be enough to defeat the proposal. But it is the latest hurdle in Tesla\u2019s lengthy campaign to sway shareholders to give Musk the largest corporate performance pay package in history. Advisory groups like ISS and Glass Lewis have also recommended voting against the pay package. Musk has argued the compensation package isn\u2019t as much about the money as it is about control. The CEO recently made that point during the company\u2019s third-quarter earnings call and has threatened to leave Tesla if the package isn\u2019t approved.

The outcome could dramatically reshape both the company\u2019s leadership structure and its stock price trajectory. The high-stakes vote has divided major institutional investors and created uncertainty about Tesla\u2019s future direction. Analysts warn that rejection of the proposal could trigger an immediate stock selloff exceeding 10%, while approval would give Musk enhanced control over the world\u2019s most valuable automaker. Major investors split on Tesla compensation Norway\u2019s massive sovereign wealth fund announced Tuesday it would vote against the pay package, despite acknowledging Musk\u2019s significant value creation for shareholders. The fund, which holds a 1.16% stake representing Tesla\u2019s sixth-largest institutional investor, expressed concerns about the compensation\u2019s total size and potential dilution effects. Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the country\u2019s government pension fund, cited the lack of key person risk mitigation as a primary concern. The fund\u2019s opposition adds weight to growing institutional resistance against executive compensation packages of unprecedented scale. However, Baron Capital Management announced strong support for the proposal Monday, arguing that Musk has built one of the world\u2019s most important companies. The asset management firm emphasized how Musk continues redefining multiple industries while creating lasting shareholder value through his leadership. Performance targets and voting control implications The proposed compensation package requires Tesla to achieve extraordinary milestones before Musk can earn the full reward. These targets include reaching an $8.5 trillion market capitalization, delivering 20 million vehicles annually, producing one million self-driving robotaxis, and manufacturing one million humanoid Optimus robots currently under development. If approved, the package would increase Musk\u2019s voting control from his current 15.8% stake to more than 25% of Tesla shares. This enhanced control would provide Musk with greater influence over strategic decisions and operational directions, particularly regarding emerging technologies like autonomous vehicles and robotics. The compensation structure reflects Tesla\u2019s board attempt to retain Musk\u2019s leadership while aligning his financial incentives with ambitious long-term growth objectives that could transform multiple industries beyond automotive manufacturing. Analyst warnings about stock price impact Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas described the shareholder meeting as potentially one of the most important events in Tesla\u2019s corporate history. He warned that rejection of the pay package would likely trigger an immediate stock selloff potentially exceeding 10%, creating uncertainty about the company\u2019s strategic future. Bank of America analyst Federico Merendi echoed similar concerns, noting that the vote poses significant risk to Tesla\u2019s stock price. He suggested that failure to approve the package could lead Musk to focus more attention on his other ventures or potentially step down from his leadership role. These analyst predictions reflect broader market concerns about Tesla\u2019s dependence on Musk\u2019s vision and leadership for maintaining investor confidence and driving innovation across multiple business segments. Board warning about Musk departure Tesla board chairperson Robyn Denholm issued a stark warning to shareholders last week, suggesting that rejection of the compensation package could result in Musk leaving the company. She emphasized the risk of losing his time, talent, and vision that have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns. The board\u2019s letter highlighted concerns about fostering an environment that motivates continued exceptional performance through equitable compensation structures. This messaging reflects the board\u2019s belief that Musk\u2019s leadership remains crucial for Tesla\u2019s continued growth and market leadership. Prediction markets currently show a 94% probability that shareholders will approve the pay package, suggesting widespread retail investor support despite institutional opposition from some major funds. Current stock performance and market outlook Tesla stock has retreated slightly from recent highs, trading around $458 af",

Norway's sovereign wealth fund, which holds a stake in Tesla, on Tuesday said it would vote against the pay package. \"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution and lack of mitigation of key person risk consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" said Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages the country's government pension fund. The fund has a 1.16% stake in Tesla, the sixth-largest holding among institutional investors. Another investor, Baron Capital Management, said Monday that it would vote in favor of the package. Musk \"has built one of the most important companies in the world,\" wrote Ron Baron, founder of the asset management firm. \"He's redefining transportation, energy and humanoid robotics and creating lasting value for shareholders while doing it. His interests are completely aligned with investors.\" Musk is the world's richest person, with Bloomberg estimating his wealth at $477 billion. Tesla's board of directors introduced the proposed pay package in early September. Musk, who controls nearly 16% of Tesla's outstanding shares, would also receive more voting power under the plan. In a Sept. 5 regulatory filing , the board described the proposed compensation package as an \"ambitious plan to retain and incentivize Mr. Musk through the issuance of a highly customized, performance-based restricted stock award.\" Tesla would be required to hit certain financial and operational milestones for Musk to earn the full pay package. Those include the company reaching a market capitalization of at least $8.5 trillion; delivering 20 million vehicles; producing 1 million self-driving \"robotaxis\"; and manufacturing 1 million of the company's humanoid robots, dubbed Optimus, which are currently under development. Robyn Denholm, chairperson of the Tesla board, warned investors last week that Musk could leave the company if shareholders reject the enhanced pay proposal. \"If we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns,\" Denholm wrote in a letter to shareholders posted on social media.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk must hit a series of ambitious goals to unlock the full $1 trillion pay package.

Norway's sovereign wealth fund said it has voted against Elon Musk's $1 trillion pay plan. The bank, which manages a $2 trillion fund, said it had concerns about the size of the package. The fight over Musk's pay is heating up, with investors set to vote on the plan on Thursday. The bank behind the world's largest sovereign wealth fund has just dealt a blow to Elon Musk's $1 trillion payday. Norges Bank Investment Management, which manages Norway's $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund , said on Tuesday it had voted against the Tesla CEO's proposed pay package ahead of the company's annual shareholder meeting on Thursday. The bank said that while it appreciated the \"significant value\" created under the billionaire's leadership, it had concerns about the size of the package, dilution, and the lack of mitigation of Musk's \"key person risk\" for Tesla. The fund, which is Tesla's sixth-largest institutional investor, also voted against Musk's previous pay package in 2024. In January, leaked messages revealed an icy text exchange between the Tesla boss and Norges' CEO Nicolai Tangen, with the billionaire telling Tangen that \"friends are as friends do.\" Norway's sovereign wealth fund is the largest institutional investor to publicly say how it has voted on the $1 trillion pay package. The fund has a 1.2% share in the EV giant. Tesla's CEO compensation plan has come under fire from some investors , including the California Public Employees Retirement System (CalPERS) and the New York State Retirement Fund. Proxy firms Glass Lewis and ISS have also urged shareholders to vote against it, prompting Musk to label them \"corporate terrorists\" in a recent earnings call. Several other big investors, including Florida's State Board of Administration and ARK Invest's Cathy Wood, have expressed support. Vanguard and BlackRock, Tesla's two largest institutional shareholders, have not yet said how they are voting. The 2025 CEO compensation plan would award Musk around $1 trillion worth of Tesla shares, assuming he hits a series of ambitious goals over the next decade. These include raising Tesla's market cap to $8.5 trillion, selling 1 million Optimus robots, boosting annual earnings way above those reported by tech giants Meta and Google, and planning his own succession. Tesla could not immediately be reached for comment.

Volley Studio They won\u2019t top out until the end of the decade, but iconic new Manhattan office towers are finally going vertical. And no wonder: Asking rents for beautiful, technologically advanced office space in prime locations are soaring toward $200 per foot. Meanwhile, the success of JPMorgan Chase\u2019s glamorous new headquarters at 270 Park Ave. is serving as proof of concept for ambitious new skyline stunners. 5 JPMorgan Chase\u2019s 270 Park addy dazles the skyline. Luiz C. Ribeiro for New York Post \u201cIt is creating a buzz about how transformative new construction is to the city,\u201d said David Goldstein of Savills. \u201cThe new construction pipeline is definitely taking shape and the first out of the ground will have pricing and timing advantage.\u201d One of the earliest will be BXP\u2019s 343 Madison Ave., designed by KPF, with 937,000 square feet. It has a letter of intent with C.V. Starr for a third of the 46-story tower, which won\u2019t be delivered until 2029.

Vornado and Rudin are also in the game. They just got city approval to build a new 1.7 million-square-foot tower at 350 Park Ave. \u2014 with Citadel as partner and a 850,000-square-foot anchor space. And Silverstein Properties is closing in on a deal with American Express to move from Brookfield Place to a new 2 World Trade Center, now likely to be around 2 million square feet. 5 Ken Griffin has approval to build a tower at 350 Park Ave. Foster + Partners In a move from Rockefeller Center, Deloitte has agreed to lease 700,000 square feet of Related\u2019s 1.1 million-square-foot 70 Hudson Yards that is now under construction.

It\u2019s a bargain compared to the entirely vacant 405-417 Park Ave. blockfront between East 54th and 55th streets being marketed by Newmark \u2014 with pricing around $500 million \u2014 for a potential tower of 700,000 square feet. Bob Knakal of BKREA is marketing dozens of land sites in Manhattan as well as 17 air rights transfers. While many of those sites will become condos, some may become offices. Although 30 million square feet worth of new towers were built over the last decade, it\u2019s nearly all leased up. Jonathan Mazur of Newmark predicts 10 million square feet will rise by 2032 to meet demand \u2014 followed by more during that decade. Some developers are seeking buildings with good bones that can be rehabbed faster than ground-up construction. \u201cInvestors are back on the hunt for offices that were labeled as `kryptonite\u2019 for a fair while,\u201d Goldstein said. A lease for the entire Chrysler Building is still up for grabs through Savills for landowner Cooper Union. SL Green would like to take charge of that partially vacant iconic Art Deco tower, but other operators are also in the mix. 5 343 Madison ",

The average UK household is now estimated to be 16% poorer than it would have been had that crisis never occurred. Given that average annual household income is around \u00a355,200 , this suggests each one is losing out to the tune of \u00a38,800 per year. Globally, it is estimated that around 100 million more people are living in absolute poverty as a direct result of the crisis. Meanwhile, government debt levels around the world increased by a third . Ever since the crisis, the general consensus among politicians and economists seems to have been that tight financial regulation is necessary to ensure a similar disaster does not happen again. The Bank of England in particular has been a global leader in pushing for new types of international safeguards. Now though, the UK government is leading calls for financial red tape to be cut . Breaking from its traditional position as an advocate for strong regulation, the Labour party has promised \u201cthe most wide-ranging package of reforms to financial services regulation in more than a decade\u201d. The idea is that easing up on the rules will boost growth by encouraging bank lending and attracting international finance. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, appears to believe that strict regulation has dampened activity in a sector which the UK economy relies upon. As his chancellor Rachel Reeves put it , existing regulation \u201chas gone too far in seeking to eliminate risk\u201d. And it\u2019s true that some regulation has been overly complex while producing few tangible benefits. But the changes signalled by Reeves and Starmer point to a much broader project of rolling back key safeguards that were put in place to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. This year, some of the regulations aimed at limiting risky mortgage lending \u2013 a key cause of the 2008 crisis \u2013 have been loosened. And Reeves has promised further sweeping changes which would, for instance, dismantle key parts of the \u201cringfencing\u201d regime which separates risky investment banking from retail banking. In doing so, she is ignoring repeated warnings by regulators (including the Bank of England) who stress that such moves will make the financial system much less stable. The risks attached to these changes are even more worrying in an environment where Donald Trump is pushing an aggressive agenda against regulation. The US and UK are both hesitant about implementing the newest version of an international framework for banking regulation which is widely regarded as critical to continued financial stability. The future of that framework will be uncertain if two of the world\u2019s biggest financial superpowers withdraw their support. Risky business Starmer clearly feels under pressure to do something to combat the UK\u2019s sluggish economic growth . But if one lesson can be taken from the 2008 crisis, it is that a small boost to economic growth at the expense of long-term stability will ultimately result in much greater losses. Even in the absence of a full-blown financial crisis, the Bank of England thinks that the higher level of instability and uncertainty associated with a laxer regulatory regime will cancel out any small short-term benefits. This chimes with the findings of my latest research , which shows that even these short-term gains are far from guaranteed. Point taken. Adam Vaughan/EPA Underlying the new enthusiasm for deregulation seems to be a belief that the financial system is now stable enough to withstand economic shocks, even if regulations are rolled back. But recent events clearly show that the risk of a financial crisis continues to b",

I\u2019ve just found 10,000 ways that won\u2019t work.\u201d \u2014 Thomas Edison Number of the Week: Daily Variation of 80 to 100 degrees C (144 to 180 degrees F) THIS WEEK: By Ken Haapala, President, Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) Scope : This TWTW begins with a discussion of false precision by Ivor Williams. Then TWTW presents an essay by Meteorologist Anthony Sadar on how ignorance is used to spread fear of climate change. TWTW offers further thoughts on why some people change their thinking about climate change, what is meant by tipping points, and issues regarding COP-30. This TWTW concludes with Bjorn Lomborg\u2019s view of the \u201cgreen transition\u201d in China. ********************* False Precision: The 2008 publication of the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) \u201cNature, Not Human Activity, Rules the Climate\u201d raised an important issue that remains today: The global temperature record is unreliable. There was no standardization of instruments, time of recording, duration of the reading, and assurance of adequate coverage. At the time, an instrument in every one of the 2,592 grid boxes of the globe, each covering 5-degree latitude and longitude was ideal. At no time has even 50% of the globe been covered, and coverage peaked in the 1970s with 46% coverage. From there it went down to about 23% in the 1990s. There was no adjustment for the urban heat island effect and other local effects. Yet organizations such as the Met Office (UK) and the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) continue to use surface-air temperatures dating back to 1850 as if they are reliable. In 1900 about 300 grid boxes were covered, less than 12%. These were mostly in the US and Western Europe and major cities in colonized parts of the world. There was little coverage elsewhere, particularly in the Southern Hemisphere. Writing in W",

Crypto Journalist Anas Hassan Crypto Journalist Anas Hassan About Author Anas is a crypto native journalist and SEO writer with over five years of writing experience covering blockchain, crypto, DeFi, and emerging tech. Author Profile Share Copied Last updated: November 15, 2025 Harvard University has expanded its Bitcoin ETF holdings by 257% in the third quarter, making the iShares Bitcoin Trust its largest disclosed position with 6.8 million shares valued at $442.8 million as of September 30. The move represents one of the most significant institutional endorsements of Bitcoin exposure among elite university endowments, ranking Harvard as the 16th-largest holder of the BlackRock-managed fund . The latest 13F filing shows Harvard increased its stake from 1.9 million shares reported in June, while simultaneously growing its gold ETF holdings by 99% to 661,391 shares worth $235 million. Bloomberg ETF analyst Eric Balchunas noted the rarity of top-tier endowments purchasing ETFs, calling it \u201c as good a validation as an ETF can get. \u201c Just checked and yeah $IBIT is now Harvard's largest position in its 13F and its biggest position increase in Q3.

Concerns are mounting that markets are now overvalued. Photograph: Alex Kraus/Bloomberg Joe Brennan Sat Nov 15 2025 - 06:00 \u2022 4 MIN READ It\u2019s hardly great timing for the 750,000 or so workers in the Republic about to be swept into the State\u2019s new automatic-enrolment pension scheme, as concerns mount that markets are well into bubble territory. The bears can point to plenty of red flags. A valuation model developed by Nobel laureate Robert Shiller puts stocks in the S&P 500 as trading at about 40 times earnings, adjusted for inflation \u2013 the second-highest level ever, trailing only the dot-com peak in 2000. As legendary investor Warren Buffett prepares to retire at the end of this year after 60 years leading Berkshire Hathaway , his famed Buffett Indicator, measuring the US market relative to the size of the economy, is hovering around an all-time high. READ MORE How to earn six figures \u2013 and still qualify for affordable housing AI posing problems for applicants and employers in recruitment arms race Hugh Linehan: Is the BBC controversy a right-wing plot? Housing stuck at the bottom of planning priorities It might help explain why the firm, as disclosed this week, now has an unprecedented $381 billion (\u20ac328 billion)\u2013 almost a third of its assets \u2013 in cash, rather than stocks and long-term bonds. The International Monetary Fund, Bank of England, and members of the European Central Bank governing council have warned in the past month about market valuation risks, while the heads of Wall Street beasts Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have predicted that equities could fall 10-20 per cent. Some believe the correction is long overdue. Take Michael Burry, the US hedge fund manager who earned more than $800 million (\u20ac689 million) for investors by speculating against sub-prime mortgage bonds during the 2008 housing crash \u2013 famously chronicled in author Michael Lewis\u2019s book, The Big Short, and its film adaptation. Burry has given up waiting for bets against some high-flying US tech giants \u2013 including artificial intelligence-focused (AI) companies Nvidia and Palantir \u2013 to pay off. It emerged this week that he informed investors just before the S&P 500 index hit a record high in late October that he was liquidating his fund. But there were signs that the trader was waving the white flag when he posted on X on October 31 st : \u201cSometimes, we see bubbles. Sometimes, there is something to do about it. Sometimes, the only winning move is not to play.\u201d It\u2019s hardly the first time that valuations have become untethered from fundamentals. But at the heart of this one is a tussle between an army of bullish small-time investors and more cautious institutional asset managers. Retail investors have grown to account for 20-30 per cent of Wall Street trading volumes, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. This surge has been fuelled by Millennials and Gen Z embracing commission-free, mobile phone trading and the rise of \u201cmeme stocks\u201d that have been going viral on social media and online forums in recent years.

Public and private capital will merge, expanding InvITs into new sectors like digital infrastructure and urban projects. Stronger regulations and increased domestic investor participation will boost market depth. Technology and ESG principles will drive operations, positioning InvITs for sustainable growth and India's economic transformation. Agencies India's infrastructure financing is transforming with Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) becoming key vehicles for stable, long-term returns. India\u2019s infrastructure financing ecosystem is undergoing a profound shift, and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) are at the heart of this transformation. Initially designed as niche instruments for institutional investors, InvITs have steadily evolved into credible, transparent, and efficient vehicles for both domestic and global investors seeking stable, long-term returns. As India enters a new phase of infrastructure expansion, 2026 is set to be a defining year for InvITs, one that could reshape the contours of infrastructure financing and investment participation. Below are five mega trends that will drive the next stage of evolution for this dynamic asset class. 1. Convergence of Public and Private Capital A key theme for 2026 will be the growing integration of public and private capital within the InvIT framework. Over the past few years, government-backed entities such as the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and Power Grid Corporation of India Limited (PGCIL) have successfully launched InvITs to monetise operational assets, setting strong precedents for transparency and efficiency in asset monetisation. This model\u2019s success may encourage other public sector undertakings and state governments to explore InvITs as a tool to unlock value from mature infrastructure assets. In 2026, this convergence is expected to accelerate, with more public utilities and state authorities turning to InvITs to fund projects in roads, renewable energy, power transmission, gas pipelines and urban infrastructure. Simultaneously, several privately managed InvITs are expected to move from private placements to public listings, expanding their investor base and improving liquidity. This blending of public and private capital will not only bridge the infrastructure financing gap but also enhance governance, investor confidence, and market depth, making InvITs a cornerstone of India\u2019s infrastructure funding model. Live Events 2. Expansion into New and Emerging Sectors The initial wave of InvITs was concentrated largely in roads and power transmission, but the next growth phase will be marked by sectoral diversification. In 2026, InvITs are poised to expand into areas such as renewable energy, digital infrastructure (including data centres and fib",

All the listed infrastructure trusts sat on big premiums to net asset values (NAVs) before the 2022-2023 interest rate hikes. Investors valued them for their chunky dividends in the depths of the near-zero rate era. They\u2019d bid up the trust\u2019s prices versus NAVs, which depressed the yields ((Because yield is dividend/price.)). But the yields on offer were still attractive to many, though not to me. (Not on a 20-30% premium to NAV!) As interest rates rose, however, those premiums wilted. Eventually the trusts were trading on 20-30% \u200bdiscounts\u200b . In most cases the dividend payments were at least held, so at least the income kept coming through. Superficially all that had changed is investors wouldn\u2019t pay a premium for income anymore. They wanted a discount, which boosted the yield for new money to 10% or more. Canada comes calling That situation unfolded over a couple of years. But my dives into infrastructure in early 2025 were prompted by something more immediate \u2013 an unexpected bid approach. One of the sector\u2019s top trusts, BBGI, was taken out by a Canadian pension fund at very close to NAV. Given that BBGI had swung from a 40% premium (!) to a 20% discount before the bid, the takeover price implied three things: An institutional-grade player saw BBGI\u2019s quoted NAV of as accurate The NAVs of the remaining listed trusts might also be be pretty trustworthy Other bid approaches could unlock value for holders It seemed a pretty good set-up. When I wrote my piece about it in early March, HICL, for instance was yielding 7.5%, just covered by income. So you were being paid to wait. Either for a recovery for the sector \u2013 probably with rate cuts \u2013 or for more takeover bids. My post on HICL concluded : While higher yields have increased discount rates and pressured asset prices, both HICL\u2019s disposals and BBGI\u2019s acquisition point to robust underlying valuations. Adding to the case are the investment qualities of infrastructure that I discussed last time . To which we might add that they aren\u2019t big US tech shares trading on all-time frothy multiples! I wouldn\u2019t go crazy loading up on infrastructure, even in deaccumulation mode. But I do think a 5-10% allocation on today\u2019s discounts makes sense, and I\u2019m working towards the lower figure myself. I\u2019m not sure the trusts will beat the market over the next five years. But the high dividends will surely smooth the ride. So far HICL has done okay. By summer the return after that Moguls piece was about 20% (including dividends) but it\u2019s slipped back. I still hold, shuffling my position size up and down as I often do . However I\u2019m not here today to do a post-mortem on that infrastructure trust. Rather I want to flag up the ones I deliberately avoided. The renewable trusts. What\u2019s wrong with renewable infrastructure? In comments to my first article, readers asked about renewable trusts. It would be hindsight to say I had a strongly bearish thesis about them. But I did note: I agree with you about renewables in terms of the potential opportunity, but the risks are a lot greater too IMHO. The truth was \u2013 and is \u2013 that renewable investment trusts give me the willies. While I have held them for brief periods, I\u2019ve invariably soon gotten out again. For what it\u2019s worth, my gut instinct has been vindicated in 2025 by the share prices: Source: Google Finance These are year-to-date returns. Clearly you\u2019d rather not have woken up on January 1 burning with a New Year\u2019s Resolution to load up on infrastructure! (Except for BBGI\u2026) The returns would be less lousy with dividends, but the renewable trusts (Tickers: TRIG, BSIF, and UKW) would still be well underwater. We can probably explain the overall weak returns with some handwaving about inflation and interest rates being higher for longer than expected, and perhaps greater political risk. I won\u2019t rehash my member posts today. But why the sharp divergence between infrastructure and renewables? Renewable infrastructure trusts under the hammer On the face of it, these infrastructure trusts all offer the same sort of thing. Upfront exposure to assets \u2013 which can be contracts to clean hospitals or fix nuclear reactors, not just physical stuff like wind turbines \u2013 in return for a stream of income over time. Sometimes the income is linked to inflation, or to other pricing mechanisms. Also note that certain assets have a definitely fixed life (contracts, for instance) whereas others, with good care, could last indefinitely (say a bridge or port). All that affects how ",

America\u2019s economic fate looks tied to AI\u2014for better or worse. By Hanna Rosin Iana Kunitsa / Getty November 13, 2025 Share Save Listen \u2212 1.0 x + 0:00 25:34 Subscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts In 2026, global spending on artificial intelligence is supposed to reach close to half a trillion dollars. Nvidia, which makes chips for pretty much all of the big AI companies, recently became the first business to be valued at $5 trillion. In the quest for superintelligence, investors have poured hundreds of billions of dollars into building data centers that will eventually demand more power than many major American cities. The investment is based on the promise that AI might one day concoct miracle drugs, program anything, automate everything\u2014inventing out into infinity. But is that day just around the corner? A decade away? And will it ever generate enough profit to make up for this staggering amount of investment? In this episode of Radio Atlantic , we talk to the Atlantic staff writer Charlie Warzel about whether the AI boom is actually a bubble. Does the promise of AI ultimately match the enormous investment? And if not, is the American economy in a new stock-market 1929? A dot-com 2000? A financial-crisis 2008? And if it is, would the Trump White House see the AI giants as too big to fail? What happens to ordinary Americans if the bubble bursts? If it doesn\u2019t\u2014if AI succeeds in paying for itself\u2014does that come at an even greater cost? The following is a transcript of the episode: [ Music ] Hanna Rosin: The amount of money invested in AI these days is astonishing\u2014almost unfathomable. You might even need AI to truly comprehend it. Recently, Nvidia, which makes chips for pretty much all of the big AI companies, became the first business ever to be valued at $5 trillion.

Nvidia is part of an elite group in the tech industry called the \u201cMagnificent Seven\u201d: seven companies that make up more than a third of the S&P 500. That\u2019s Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla, all of which have made some pretty hefty investments into AI in the last few years. Charlie Warzel: Honestly, the amount of money and energy that\u2019s being poured into this is staggering. Global spending is projected to hit $375 billion this year. And in 2026, the figure is supposed to go up to close to a half a trillion dollars. Rosin: That\u2019s Charlie Warzel, who covers tech at The Atlantic and who recently wrote about this topic with our colleague Matteo Wong. Warzel: There\u2019s really no way to put in context, without sounding ridiculous or super vague, just how much money is going into this. We\u2019re talking in historic terms. Rosin: Back in 2019\u2014a couple of years before OpenAI launched ChatGPT\u2014its CEO, Sam Altman, spoke to a group of industry observers. He was asked how exactly OpenAI plans to make money as a business. And here\u2019s what he said. Sam Altman (from StrictlyVC ): The honest answer\u2019s we have no idea. We have never made any revenue. We have no current plans to make revenue. We have no idea how we may one day generate revenue. We have made a soft promise to investors that once we\u2019ve built this sort of generally intelligent system, basically, we will ask it to figure out a way to generate an investment return for you. ( Audience laughs. ) Rosin: In the years since, AI has come a long way. It\u2019s crept into our emails, our term papers. It\u2019s made its way into medical-image analysis, large data sets that companies use to make projections, our late-night musings. But one thing it has not done is make money on a scale that even remotely matches these mind-boggling investments. So the obvious questions have started coming up more and more: Is this AI boom actually a bubble? [ Music ] Rosin: A little over a week ago, an OpenAI investor named Brad Gerstner posed the question on everyone\u2019s mind, about this gap between money going out and coming in. Brad Gerstner (from BG2 ): How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments? And you\u2019ve heard the criticism, Sam. Sam Altman: First of all, we\u2019re doing well more revenue than that. Second of",

We are therefore accelerating and extending our savings efforts. We remain confident in the strategic direction of our growth engines. HealthCare IT\u2019s shift to the cloud significantly strengthens the company\u2019s long-term positioning as a global leader in Enterprise IT, while as expected temporarily impacting revenue and profit. This strategic evolution is supported by strong customer satisfaction and the signing of several high-value contracts in 2025. In Digital Printing Solutions, we continue to build a robust portfolio of high-end and mid-range offerings. Although current market conditions are currently slow, especially in the USA, the company anticipates renewed demand as economic stability returns. The Green Hydrogen Solutions business delivered a solid third quarter. Growth in Western markets is currently moderate but the company is successfully expanding its footprint in Eastern regions. The inauguration of a new ZIRFON membrane production unit in September marks a significant milestone in our commitment to the clean energy transition.\" Pascal Ju\u00e9ry, President and CEO of the Agfa-Gevaert Group. Acceleration and extension of restructuring plans Agfa is accelerating and extending the plan to optimize the cost base of the traditional film activities. The current plan, which is expected to bring 50 million euro of savings, is being accelerated through faster implementation. An additional plan is being initiated that is expected to bring additional savings of 25 million euro related to manufacturing activities as well as go-to-market adjustments. The company is implementing short-term measures across the Group to help mitigate the current results. Agfa is working on an initiative to rightsize the overall Group organization. Details of the plan will be communicated in due time. Agfa is exploring the potential redevelopment of part of its site in Mortsel, Belgium. As a first step, Agfa has submitted a request to the Flemish government to start negotiations with a view to concluding a Brownfield Covenant.

However, a shift is occurring with expectations that the worst is over. Domestic mutual funds are increasing their holdings, providing market stability. Analysts are optimistic about India's future growth prospects, projecting potential gains for the Nifty index.

Foreign institutional investors (FIIs) have slashed Rs 80,000 crore from just 10 of India's most prized stocks\u2014Reliance Industries (RIL), TCS , Titan , and HDFC Bank among them\u2014as a brutal year-long exodus pushes foreign ownership of Indian equities to its lowest level in over a decade. Yet amid the carnage, a surprising consensus is emerging on Wall Street and Dalal Street alike: the worst may finally be over. TCS bore the heaviest blow, with FIIs dumping an estimated Rs 12,911 crore as their stake plunged from 11.5% to 10.3% in the September quarter, according to data from Prime Database. Reliance Industries wasn't far behind, shedding Rs 10,042 crore as foreign holdings slipped from 19.2% to 18.7%. Eternal saw Rs 9,854 crore in outflows as FII ownership dropped from 42.3% to 39%. ICICI Bank witnessed sizeable withdrawals of Rs 9,375 crore as FII holding fell from 46.8% to 45.6%. Others in the list include HCL Tech , Kotak Mahindra Bank , Infosys , Axis Bank , HDFC Bank and Titan. The carnage was equally visible in stock prices\u2014TCS tumbled 16.6%, HCL Tech collapsed 19.9%, Trent plummeted 24.8%, and Infosys dropped 10% during the quarter as foreign money fled. On the flip side, some companies emerged as beneficiaries of FII inflows. Yes Bank , Maruti Suzuki , Hindustan Unilever (HUL), Waaree Energies, and AWL Agri Business saw FIIs hike their stakes significantly\u2014Yes Bank alone clocked a Rs 12,548 crore net buy. Live Events Sectorally, FIIs increased their allocation to consumer discretionary stocks, while cutting back most on financial services. DIIs mirrored this shift, but also slashed exposure to IT. \"Foreigners have net sold $30 billion over the past year (second largest historically) pushing foreign ownership and mutual fund allocations near two-decade lows,\" said Goldman Sachs' Sunil Koul. \"However, recent reversals suggest improving foreign risk appetite and flows as earnings recover.\" Goldman Sachs, which had downgraded India in October last year, has now taken a dramatic U-turn\u2014upgrading the country back to overweight and projecting Nifty can hit 29,000 by 2026-end amid growth-supportive policies, earni",

(\u201cHudbay\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (TSX, NYSE: HBM) released its third quarter 2025 financial results today. All amounts are in U.S. dollars, unless otherwise noted. \"This was a quarter of resilience for Hudbay as we demonstrated the strength of our operating capabilities and the benefit of our diversified operating platform at a time of mandatory wildfire evacuations in Manitoba and temporary operational interruptions in Peru,\u201d said Peter Kukielski, President and Chief Executive Officer. \u201cThrough our team\u2019s continued focus on delivery and driving operating efficiencies in the face of these challenges, we expect to achieve the low end of our consolidated copper and gold production guidance ranges and we are further improving our consolidated cost guidance for 2025. During the third quarter, we continued to take steps to reduce long-term debt, reinvest in high-return growth projects and advance our strategic initiatives to build a stable and diversified operating platform with significant copper growth upside. We are delighted to have secured a premier long-term strategic partner in Mitsubishi, enabling us to unlock significant value in our copper growth pipeline, further solidify our financial strength and significantly reduce our share of the remaining capital contributions for the development of Copper World. Hudbay's unique copper and gold diversification, combined with our continued focus on cost control, enable us to maintain industry-leading margins and deliver strong and stable cash flows.\u201d Demonstrated Operating Resilience in the Third Quarter Achieved revenue of $346.8 million and adjusted EBITDA i of $142.6 million in the third quarter of 2025. Achieved consolidated copper production of 24,205 tonnes and consolidated gold production of 53,581 ounces in the third quarter, demonstrating strong operational resilience with Manitoba operations suspended for the majority of the quarter due to the wildfire evacuations and temporary operational interruptions in Peru. Strong cost performance continued in the third quarter with consolidated cash cost i and sustaining cash cost i per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, of $0.42 and $2.09, respectively. Reaffirmed full year 2025 consolidated production guidance for copper and gold, despite the temporary operational interruptions and production deferrals. Full-year consolidated copper and gold production is now expected to be near the low end of the guidance ranges. Further improved full year 2025 consolidated cash cost i guidance range to $0.15 to $0.35 per pound, an additional improvement from the previously updated guidance range of $0.65 to $0.85 per pound, as year-to-date results are trending well below the low end of the cost ranges. Also improved full year 2025 consolidated sustaining cash cost guidance range to $1.85 to $2.25 per pound copper from the original guidance range of $2.25 to $2.65 per pound as a result of increased exposure to gold by-product credits and continued strong operating cost control. Peru operations produced 18,114 tonnes of copper and 26,380 ounces of gold in the third quarter, with copper being slightly lower than quarterly cadence expectations and gold far exceeding quarterly cadence expectations while navigating intermittent interruptions and a temporary mill suspension during the quarter. Peru cash cost i per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, was $1.30 in the third quarter, outperforming the low-end of the cost guidance range. Full year copper production in Peru is expected to be in line with 2025 annual guidance and full year gold production is expected to exceed the top end of the guidance range. Manitoba operations produced 22,441 ounces of gold in the third quarter, lower than quarterly cadence expectations as a result of temporary production interruptions from mandatory wildfire evacuations that shut down operations for the majority of the third quarter and deferred gold production. A business interruption insurance claim has been submitted to compensate for a portion of the wildfire-related downtime. Manitoba cash cost i per ounce of gold produced, net of by-product credits, was $379 in the third quarter. Subsequent to the quarter, due to additional unplanned down time in October as a result of winter storm power outages, some gold production has been further deferred and full year gold production in Manitoba is now expected to be slightly below the low end of the 2025 annual guidance range. British Columbia operations produced 5,249 tonnes of copper in the third quarter at a cash cost i per pound of copper produced, net of by-product credits, of $3.21.

Nepal\u2019s economic landscape reflects a mix of cautious optimism and structural challenges. The NEPSE index made a mild recovery after three days of losses, though trading volume declined, indicating subdued investor confidence, while surging gold and silver prices pointed to rising demand for safe-haven assets. On the policy front, Nepal secured $14.4 million in international grants for climate resilience, and the government designated 16 water and energy projects as national priorities to strengthen infrastructure and energy security. The central bank remained active\u2014investing Rs 3.7 billion from its pension fund, mandating licenses for casino currency exchanges, and supporting startups through concessional loans. Meanwhile, issues such as project delays, land administration inefficiencies, and disputes over electricity tariffs underscored persistent governance and regulatory hurdles. Corporate and sectoral developments, including Sahas Urja\u2019s dividend announcement and Nepal Airlines\u2019 expanded domestic flights, reflected gradual progress in industry and services, even as agriculture suffered weather-related setbacks and cooperative inefficiency highlighted deeper institutional weaknesses. N EPSE index edges up after three days of decline The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) index recorded a modest gain on Tuesday, rising by 3.21 points to close at 2,565.16, halting a three-day losing streak. Despite the uptick, overall market turnover fell to Rs 3.62 billion from Rs 4.51 billion the previous day. Out of all listed companies, 142 saw their share prices increase while 102 declined. All sector indices posted changes below 1%. Four newly listed firms \u2014 Bandipur Cable Car, Mabilung Energy, Sagar Distillery, and Bungel Hydropower \u2014 saw their stock prices jump by 10%, while City Hotel reported the largest drop at 4.96%. Gold and silver prices soar in domestic market Gold prices in the domestic market surged by Rs 4,900 per tola (11.66 grams) on Tuesday, reaching Rs 246,400 per tola, up from Rs 241,500 on Monday, according to the Federation of Nepal Gold and Silver Dealers Association. Silver prices also rose by Rs 105 per tola, hitting Rs 3,170 compared to Rs 3,065 the previous day. Nepal receives $14.4 million in climate resilience grants Nepal has obtained USD 14.4 million in total grant funding for projects focused on environmental protection and climate-resilient livelihoods. Of this amount, USD 8.7 million will come from the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through an agreement with the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to promote climate-resilient paddy farming in central Nepal. In addition, USD 2.2 million has been allocated for restoring forest and mountain ecosystems in Sudurpashchim Province, while another USD 4.2 million will fund local-level livelihood programs designed to help communities adapt to floods, droughts, and other climate-related risks. NRB to invest Rs 3.7 billion from pension fund Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) has announced plans to invest Rs 3.7 billion from its Gratuity and Pension Fund into domestic banks and financial institutions for a one-year term. The allocation includes Rs 2.96 billion for \u2018A\u2019 class commercial banks, Rs 555 million for national-level \u2018B\u2019 class development banks, and Rs 185 million for national-level finance companies. Institutions applying for the investment must meet specific financial standards, such as maintaining adequate capital, keeping non-performing loans (NPLs) below 8%, and having reported profits in the previous fiscal year. Sunkoshi Marin project initiates contractor termination process The Sunkoshi Marin Diversion Multipurpose Project\u2014a key National Pride Project\u2014has started proceedings to terminate its contract with Patel-Raman JV. A public notice issued Tuesday asked the contractor to justify why its Rs 14.08 billion contract should not be cancelled. The decision follows extremely slow progress, with only 10% of work completed despite 61% of the contract period having elapsed. The project also plans to seize the contractor\u2019s bank guarantees worth Rs 3.6 billion, including Rs 2.4 billion in performance bonds and Rs 1.2 billion in advance payment guarantees.

Tenneco Clean Air India Ltd, part of the US-based Tenneco Group, on Tuesday said it has raised Rs 1,080 crore from anchor investors, just a day before opening of its initial public offering (IPO) for public subscription. The anchor book saw participation from 58 entities including SBI Mutual Fund (MF), ICICI Prudential MF, HDFC MF, SBI Life Insurance, ICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Nomura Funds Ireland, Fidelity, BlackRock, Norway's Government Pension Fund Global, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, and Goldman Sachs, according to a circular uploaded on BSE's website. Also read Tenneco Clean Air India IPO opens today at \u20b9378-397 As per the circular, the company allocated a little over 2.72 crore equity shares at an anchor investor offer price of Rs 397 per share, raising a total of Rs 1,079.99 crore. Among these, more than 1.47 crore equity shares, or 54.15 per cent, were allocated to 17 domestic mutual funds, which have applied through a total of 41 schemes. Also read Gift Nifty indicates 150-point gap-up opening as exit polls boost investor sentiment The Rs 3,600-crore IPO will be opened for public subscription on November 12 and conclude on November 14. The company has fixed a price band at Rs 378-397 per share. It aims for a valuation of over Rs 16,000 crore at the upper end. The proposed IPO is entirely an Offer for Sale (OFS) by the promoter Tenneco Mauritius Holdings Ltd, with no fresh equity issuance. The company has raised its issue size to Rs 3,600 crore from Rs 3,000 crore planned earlier, according to the draft papers filed in June. Since the issue is entirely an OFS, the company will not receive any proceeds from the IPO and all funds raised will go directly to the selling shareholder. The objective of the IPO is to achieve the benefits of listing, the papers stated. Tenneco Mauritius Holdings Ltd, Tenneco (Mauritius) Ltd, Federal-Mogul Investments BV, Federal-Mogul Pty LTD, and Tenneco LLC are the promoters of the company.

Instead, everyone has an account that holds their money. You cannot purchase goods or services without access to government-based cryptocurrency. Even if the currency itself is still backed by faith in the government, you have to use this electronic system. The result is multiple problems that could leave you in a situation where you have the money in the bank to pay your bills and purchase goods and services, yet you cannot do so. These threats include: Attacks Sponsored by Foreign Governments These hacks usually affect the bank or primary clearinghouse rather than a specific person\u2019s account. You may be unable to purchase goods or services for hours or days. While this is inconvenient, it isn\u2019t as bad as a full collapse, where the banks close for good. There\u2019s only so much you can do about this kind of hack other than make sure you can go two weeks without buying anything at any given time. It is also essential to keep a paper-based address book with phone numbers and account information so that you can contact utility companies or others who may be expecting payments from you while the bank or clearinghouse is down. Let\u2019s say you can connect to Wi-Fi independently of the SIM Card. Your phone app may not work with Wi-Fi. This is why I recommend having an app on your phone that doesn\u2019t use the SIM card to dial out on Wi-Fi so that you can make the necessary calls. Attacks Sponsored by Non-government Groups If the hacker was able to steal money from your accounts, it could take weeks to years before you recover the money. In the short term, you will have to shut down credit cards and so on, then wait for new ones to come in the mail. You may also have to manage restoring devices and regaining access to your accounts. Here again, make sure you can go at least 2 weeks without buying anything so that you can manage your basic necessities. Merchant Category Codes and Social Credit Scores Merchant Category Codes are unique identifiers that put different products into separate categories. For example, food has one set of numeric identifiers, while clothing has other identifiers. Even without looking at your receipt, the bank and transaction clearinghouse may have some ideas about what you bought. The transaction cost can then give some estimates about quantity and item type. One day, data from all banks and clearinghouses may pool into a central government computer. Social credit scores work like your financial-based credit scores. Consider how your financial credit score enables businesses to \u201creward\u201d you with credit or better interest rates if you pay your bills on time and have an optimal debt-to-income ratio. Your social credit score looks at how you act in society. For example, China has a system that rewards things like donating blood. This same system \u201cpunishes\u201d people who drive drunk or engage in other activities that aren\u2019t \u201cbeneficial to society.\u201d People with good social credit scores may get tax breaks, an increased chance of getting a promotion, or other benefits. When vaccines became available for COVID-19, governments worldwide were concerned because people hesitated to embrace mRNA vaccines. This led to people not complying with recommendations to get vaccinated. Social credit scores can be paired with cashless systems that will block purchasing from specific merchant category codes. It could become possible to deny people the ability to buy food, gas, and other essentials if they aren\u2019t vaccinated. When you can\u2019t use cash, pressure campaigns like this will be almost 100% effective because you will have to comply or do without the necessities of life. The only way to outlast a pressure campaign like this is to have a stockpile of food and other essentials that will last until the pressure tactics are stopped. Moving Away From Hard Cash to Fiat Cryptocurrency At first, you might think merchant credit codes will only come into play when the government seeks to limit, slow down, or prevent purchasing certain goods and services. The problem is that modern networks aren\u2019t safe from hackers, including those who seek to disrupt trade for ethical reasons. For example, the Internet Archive was recently targeted by a hacktivist group, Blackmeta. They claim they attacked this non-profit library site because it is based in the USA and, therefore, is aligned with Israeli activities. Ironically, the Internet Archive has been locked in multiple court battles with publishers that may be far more aligned with Israel. These publishers, in turn, are trying to shut down the Internet Archive because when people don\u2019t buy from the publisher, ",

Last time the US reopened after a shutdown, Bitcoin soared 300% in 5 months - what will happen this time? By Piyush Shukla , Global Desk Last Updated: Nov 10, 2025, 06:45:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Bitcoin is flashing d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as Washington inches toward ending the 40-day U.S. government shutdown. Bitcoin trades near $106,158. It rose 3.9% in 24 hours. The U.S. shutdown optimism drives gains. Last time in 2019, after reopening, Bitcoin jumped 300% in five months. Prices hit $106,552 high, $102,166 low today. ETF inflows added $1.2 billion last week. Market cap stands above $2 trillion. Open interest rose 9%. Whale accumulation increased. Exchange reserves fell 4%. Analysts see sentiment boost if Washington resolves gridlock. But Fed\u2019s hawkish tone and 3.4% inflation limit upside. Traders eye $150,000 target if clarity returns. D\u00e9j\u00e0 vu for Bitcoin? As the U.S. shutdown nears its end, traders recall the 2019 reopening rally that sent BTC soaring 300% \u2014 could history repeat again? Bitcoin is flashing a powerful sense of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu as the U.S. government moves closer to ending its 40-day shutdown , and traders can\u2019t stop looking back at 2019. That year, after Washington reopened, Bitcoin soared nearly 300% in just five months \u2014 rising from around $3,500 to $13,000 . Now, as the Senate inches toward a new deal, investors are wondering if history is about to rhyme again. Analysts recall that during the 2018\u201319 shutdown, risk sentiment flipped sharply once federal operations resumed, leading to massive inflows into crypto. Bitcoin then jumped from roughly $3,500 in January 2019 to nearly $14,000 by June that year, fueled by renewed liquidity, investor confidence, and easing macro tension. This time, conditions look both similar and different. The crypto market is far larger, with institutional exposure through Bitcoin ETFs and major fund flows from asset managers. Over $1.2 billion in ETF inflows were recorded last week alone, helping BTC rebound after a brief correction from record highs above $125,000. On Monday, prices touched an intraday low of $102,166 before climbing toward $106,552 as traders priced in hopes of a deal in Washington. Market data shows volatility rising with open interest up 9% in derivatives, while funding rates on major exchanges remain positive, suggesting bullish sentiment persists. Historical behavior shows Bitcoin tends to rally sharply when macro uncertainty clears. The last shutdown ended with a relief rally across risk assets, and Bitcoin outperformed nearly every traditional index. Traders now debate whether a similar surge is possible, given the higher price base and tighter liquidity conditions. Bitcoin\u2019s market cap stands above $2 trillion, meaning a 300% rise from current levels would take it past $400,000 \u2014 a level few see achievable without a major liquidity wave. Live Events However, there are supporting signals. U.S. equity futures are steady, Treasury yields are easing, and risk appetite is improving. The Nasdaq is up 1.4% this week, while gold and silver also rallied, reflecting a broader rotation back into risk and inflation hedges. On-chain data from Glassnode shows Bitcoin whale accumulation hitti",

Home Markets Lenskart shares end at \u20b9403 level after volatile first-day trade We didn\u2019t build Lenskart to reach a valuation, we built it to reach people, says Peyush Bansal, CEO, Lenskart By Madhu Balaji Updated - November 10, 2025 at 05:00 PM. | Bengaluru \u00d7 Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/markets/lenskart-sees-subdued-debut-below-402-ipo-price-on-nse-bse/article70261488.ece Copy Eyewear retailer Lenskart Solutions Ltd made a muted debut and experienced hightened volatility on Monday, listing at discount compared to its issue price of \u20b9402 per share. The stock opened at \u20b9390 on the BSE , reflecting nearly 3 per cent discount, while on the NSE , it debuted slightly higher at \u20b9395 (1.7 per cent discount). After moderating between \u20b9356.10 and \u20b9413.80, it settled at \u20b9403.10 and at \u20b9403.30 on the NSE and BSE, respectively. Market analysts attributed the weak listing to valuation concerns and profit-booking by short-term investors, despite Lenskart\u2019s strong brand recall and growth prospects in India\u2019s organised eyewear market. According to Shivani Nyati, Head of Wealth at Swastika Investmart Ltd, the tepid debut indicated muted response despite strong brand visibility and market dominance in the eyewear segment. Speaking at the listing ceremony, Peyush Bansal, CEO, Lenskart, said, \u201cWe believe profit is oxygen, but purpose is breath.\u201d The moment like this has been built over 15 years, the company was started small to solve one human problem - giving sight and making it accessible, Bansal stated. \u201cOperational excellence became our language. We didn\u2019t build Lenskart to reach a valuation, we built it to reach people,\u201d he added. He affirmed the commitment that the company will continue to serve its purpose of providing high-quality eyewear accessible to all. Nyati advised investors allotted with shares may consider holding for the medium to long term, supported by earnings visibility and expanding store footprint, with a stop loss around \u20b9350. Short-term traders may exit the position and look for better opportunities elsewhere.

He highlights the 3-5 year segment in high-quality corporate bonds as offering a better balance of yield, stability, and liquidity in the current evolving market conditions. Agencies And if there is no rate cut and the market moves sideways, the current spreads of around 80 bps on AAA corporate bonds are on the higher side and should provide a cushion. In this edition of ETMarkets Smart Talk Livestream, Prateek Jain , CFA & Head of Fixed Income, Capitalmind MF outlines why investors should be cautious about taking exposure to very long-duration bonds in the current environment. While interest rate expectations are gradually shifting, he notes that duration risk remains elevated at the far end of the yield curve. Instead, Jain highlights the 3\u20135-year segment in high-quality corporate bonds as offering a more favorable balance of yield, stability, and liquidity. Speaking to Kshitij Anand of ETMarkets, he discussed how investors can position fixed income portfolios to optimise returns while managing risks as market conditions evolve. Edited Excerpts \u2013 Kshitij Anand: Let us get your perspective from the macro space. Despite a supportive backdrop with rate cuts and rating upgrades, bond yields have risen. What does this divergence reveal about the evolving trend in India's fixed income markets? Prateek Jain: Yes, bond yields have increased, but not across the board. The curve has steepened significantly. Typically, at the longer end of the curve\u201415-year, 30-year maturities\u2014the spreads have expanded by almost 15 bps to nearly 75 bps. In contrast, the shorter end of the curve, from three months up to five years, has come down meaningfully. If you look at the last three CPI prints, the average is close to 1.75%, which is a multi-year low. Bonds Corner Powered By Why are RBI's Floating Rate Bonds becoming the new safe haven for low-risk investors? Investors are increasingly favoring RBI's Floating Rate Bonds, a secure government-backed debt instrument, over traditional bank deposits and small-savings schemes. Offering an 8.05% return linked to the National Savings Certificate rate plus 35 basis points, these seven-year bonds provide a higher yield and hedge against rising interest rates.

Home Companies CII proposes India Development and Strategic Fund to finance long-term growth CII has suggested that India\u2019s existing National Investment and Infrastructure Fund (NIIF) could be evolved into this Developmental Arm, leveraging its governance architecture and global investor base By BL New Delhi Bureau Updated - November 10, 2025 at 08:00 AM. \u00d7 Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/cii-proposes-india-development-and-strategic-fund-to-finance-long-term-growth/article70259284.ece Copy CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee CII has proposed setting up an India Development and Strategic Fund (IDSF)--a sovereign-backed, professionally managed institution to finance India\u2019s long-term growth, resilience and global economic security. Conceived as a twin-arm national fund, the IDSF would mobilise patient, long-horizon capital to build India\u2019s productive capacity at home and secure critical economic interests abroad, the industry chamber suggested. Announcing the proposal, CII Director General Chandrajit Banerjee said \u201cIndia is entering a decisive window of opportunity. We are already among the world\u2019s largest economies, but to reach developed-economy status by 2047 we need structural, perpetual sources of long-term capital that go beyond the annual budget cycle.\u201d The India Development and Strategic Fund would be a sovereign-anchored, professionally managed instrument that invests in both national capacity and strategic security, he added. CII\u2019s proposal is based on the recognition that India\u2019s growth ambitions in infrastructure, energy transition, manufacturing, technology and human development, will require funding at a scale that cannot be met by annual budgetary allocations alone. The Fund would help mobilise domestic and global savings and recycle national capital from mature assets into new productive capacity. \u201cThis is not about more borrowing. It is about better capital structuring, recycling our existing national strength into future assets instead of one-time fiscal use,\u201d Banerjee explained. The IDSF is envisaged as comprising two distinct but coordinated arms. The Developmental Investment Arm would focus on financing long-gestation domestic priorities such as infrastructure, clean energy, logistics, industrial corridors, MSME scale-up, education & skilling, healthcare and urban infrastructure. It would also provide patient equity and blended finance to commercially viable projects that require long-term commitment. It would act as an anchor investor, crowding in pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and institutional investors from India and abroad.

Under the OFS, promoters\u2014Peyush Bansal, Neha Bansal, Amit Chaudhary, and Sumeet Kapahi\u2014along with investors SVF II Lightbulb (Cayman) Ltd, Schroders Capital Private Equity Asia Mauritius Ltd, PI Opportunities Fund II, Macritchie Investments Pte. Ltd., Kedaara Capital Fund II LLP, and Alpha Wave Ventures LP, offloaded shares. Lenskart earlier raised Rs 3,268.36 crore from anchor investors. Among the investors in the anchor book were domestic mutual funds such as SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential, Kotak Mutual Fund, Axis Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life, Government Pension Fund Global, Steadview Capital, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan and HSBC. Expansion plans It proposes to use the proceeds for strategic initiatives, including capital expenditure to set up company-operated, company-owned stores in India, and payments under lease, rent, and licence agreements for these stores. Valuation worries Meanwhile, Ambit Capital initiated coverage of Lenskart with a sell rating ahead of the listing, flagging valuation concerns even as the eyewear retailer continues to deliver strong revenue growth and expand its domestic and global footprint. The brokerage flagged a sharp disconnect between the company\u2019s growth prospects and its return ratios. Ambit said its target price of Rs 337 implies EV/EBITDA multiples of 45x and 22x for the India and international businesses, respectively. Earlier, SBI Mutual Fund had invested Rs 100 crore in an eyewear retailer at an enterprise valuation of around $7.7 billion (approximately Rs 70,000 crore), marking one of the largest pre-IPO investments by a domestic institutional investor in a new-age consumer company.

This, he said, must be considered at the time of drafting laws. \u2014 Pointing to the need for judgments and legal documents to be made available in local languages, he said that when people comprehend the law in their own language, it will lead to better compliance and reduce litigation. \u2014 Referring to the crucial role that legal aid plays in ensuring such accessibility, he said legal services authorities act as a bridge between the judiciary and the common citizen, from the national to the taluka level. \u2014 Modi said lakhs of disputes are being resolved swiftly, amicably, and at low cost through Lok Adalats and pre-litigation settlements. He pointed out that nearly 8 lakh criminal cases were resolved in just three years under the Legal Aid Defence Counsel System initiated by the government.

This professionally managed fund aims to finance India's long-term growth and secure critical economic interests globally. The proposal envisions a substantial corpus by 2047, funded through asset monetisation and equity transfers. It will invest in domestic development and strategic overseas acquisitions. Industry lobby CII on Sunday urged the government to establish a professionally managed India Development and Strategic Fund to finance the country's long-term growth , resilience, and secure critical economic interests abroad. India needs a twin-armed India Development and Strategic Fund (IDSF) to power growth and secure the country's strategic future, the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) said. Conceived as a national fund, IDSF would mobilise patient, long-horizon capital to build India's productive capacity at home and secure critical economic interests abroad, it added. CII believes that with disciplined design and funding, IDSF could, over the next two decades, build a managed corpus in the range of USD 1.3 to 2.6 trillion by 2047, comparable in ambition and credibility to the world's leading sovereign investors. The proposed capitalisation roadmap includes a modest initial budgetary allocation to establish credibility, followed by systematic channelling of a share of asset monetisation proceeds, from roads, transmission lines, ports, and spectrum, into the fund instead of one-time deficit reduction. Live Events You Might Also Like: India's big bank moment has arrived. Why it matters Over time, a portion of the government's equity in select public sector enterprises could be transferred to the fund, turning these enterprises into instruments for India's global expansion rather than mere disinvestment candidates, it suggested. In addition, the fund could issue thematic instruments, such as infrastructure, green and diaspora bonds to mobilise long-term domestic and international savings, while co-investing with multilateral and bilateral partners. Once macroeconomic buffers are adequate, a calibrated allocation of a small portion of India's foreign exchange reserves could also be considered for overseas strategic acquisitions in areas like critical minerals and energy, CII stressed. Chandrajit Banerjee, Director General, CII, said the time has come for India to build its own enduring financial engine for development.

The CII's proposal is based on the recognition that India's growth ambitions in infrastructure, energy transition, manufacturing, technology, and human development will require funding at a scale that cannot be met by annual budgetary allocations alone.

By Jaisal Noor , T ruthout Published November 8, 2025 A protester waves a Palestinian flag in front of a few hundred students gathered to protest the genocide in Gaza at the Johns Hopkins University Homewood Campus on April 30, 2024, in Baltimore, Maryland. Wesley Lapointe / The Washington Post via Getty Images Truthout is a vital news source and a living history of political struggle. If you think our work is valuable, support us with a donation of any size. On a cold, sunny morning in October, Grace Smith, a 42-year-old Baltimore County middle school teacher, arrived at the annual statewide teachers union convention in Ocean City, Maryland, with two fellow educators and a folder full of zines. Their mission: talk to as many teachers as possible about Maryland\u2019s pension investments in Israel and hand out every copy they\u2019d brought. Smith estimated that they spoke to dozens of educators and distributed over 200 zines. The response, she said, was overwhelmingly positive. \u201cEveryone I talked to was glad to hear about it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t know about it \u2014 and they were pissed.\u201d As part of a national movement to end U.S. complicity in Israel\u2019s ethnic cleansing of Palestine, Maryland Break the Bonds produced the zine to explain how Israel finances its genocide in Gaza and settlement expansion in the occupied West Bank by selling \u201cIsrael Bonds,\u201d and how, according to information gleaned through FOIA requests, the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System (MSRPS) holds more than $70 million in these bonds despite recent credit downgrades and a growing divestment push. Its demand is simple: \u201cInvest Maryland money in Maryland\u2019s future, not in genocide.\u201d Representing one-tenth of 1 percent of Maryland\u2019s $70 billion portfolio, the holdings have become a symbolic target in a campaign focused on the system\u2019s 420,000 members \u2014 teachers, state workers, and municipal employees.

By Derek Seidman , T ruthout November 6, 2025 Truthout Smith learned about the campaign through a weekly vigil for Gaza held in Baltimore, Maryland, that she attends regularly. As an educator, she said she was especially shaken by reports that Israel, backed by U.S. weapons and aid, has killed one Palestinian child every hour , and destroyed 90 percent of schools in Gaza. The thought that her retirement is bound up in that destruction haunts her. \u201cIt\u2019s a hellscape to have your ability to retire depend on continuing the U.S. war machine,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why it\u2019s acceptable for a pension fund to grow through investing in genocide. I just know it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.\u201d Smith was drawn to the campaign because it builds on the legacy of previous divestment movements. \u201cOf all the tactics, divestment has been one of the most effective,\u201d she said. The U.S. Investing Against the Global Tide Over the past two years, the U.S. has supplied Israel with more than $21 billion in military aid , but public opinion is changing.

We also realized record monetizations of $15 billion, underscoring the strength of our platform across a broad range of strategies.\u201d He continued, \u201cIn October, we announced an agreement to acquire the remaining interest in Oaktree. Over the past six years, this partnership has exceeded all expectations, and full ownership will allow us to work together more closely\u2014deepening collaboration across our businesses, driving greater efficiency, and enhancing the value we deliver to our clients and shareholders.\u201d Financial Results We delivered record results in the third quarter, underscored by strong capital inflows and robust deployments.

Fee-related earnings (\u201cFRE\u201d) were a record $754 million or $0.46 per share in the quarter, a 17% increase over the prior year. Over the last twelve months, FRE increased 19% to $2.8 billion, or $1.72 per share, with margins expanding to 58% in the quarter, and 57% over the last twelve months. Distributable earnings (\u201cDE\u201d) were $661 million, or $0.41 per share in the quarter and $2.6 billion, or $1.58 per share over the last twelve months, up 7% and 12%, respectively. Operating Results Earnings growth was driven by record organic fundraising of $30 billion in the quarter and over $100 billion in the past twelve months. Fee-bearing capital grew to $581 billion, up 8% year-over-year, driven by strong fundraising and deployments within our infrastructure, transition, and credit businesses. Our successful quarterly fundraising came from a broad range of strategies, with nearly 80% of capital raised coming from our complementary strategies. Some of the more notable progress on our fundraising efforts include: During the quarter, we held the final institutional closing of the second vintage of our global transition flagship strategy for $20 billion. This exceeded our target and the record set by the prior vintage to become the world\u2019s largest private fund dedicated to the transition to clean energy. This continues the strong momentum from our most recent flagship real estate fund, which also exceeded expectations and, on close of the regional sleeves, will be our largest real estate strategy ever raised at more than $17 billion. We expect fundraising momentum to continue in the coming quarters, led by the seventh vintage of our private equity flagship fund, which we recently launched; the sixth vintage of our infrastructure flagship fund, which we expect to launch in early 2026; and the first close of our inaugural AI Infrastructure fund expected before year-end. We expect both our private equity and infrastructure flagships to be the largest in their respective series, with the AI Infrastructure fund among our largest first-time strategies. We have also continued to see an increasingly more favorable transaction environment driven by the enduring global investment themes on which we focus. We deployed a total of $23 billion into attractive investment opportunities during the quarter, marking our largest quarter for deployments ever. Market conditions have likewise supported our ability to monetize investments at strong valuations. During the quarter, we sold assets valued at $25 billion, representing $15 billion of equity value.

Third Quarter Highlights Deliveries: 1,114 equivalent units (\"EUs\"), with 27.6% being battery- and fuel cell-electric buses (\u201cZEBs\u201d) Revenue : $879.9 million, an increase of 23.7% year-over-year Gross Loss: $114.3 million, the Company would have reported a Gross Profit of $115.6 million, with gross margin of 13.1%, without the impact of the battery recall warranty provisions Net Loss: $140.9 million, with Net Loss per Share of $1.18, impacted by the battery recall warranty provisions Adjusted Net Earnings 1 : $12.1 million and Adjusted Net Earnings per Share 1 of $0.10 Net cash generated by operating activities: $83.9 million, positively impacted by working capital benefits from battery recall provision charges, advance customer payments, and decreases in interest and finance costs Adjusted EBITDA 1 : $80.9 million, an increase of 52.1% year-over-year Backlog 1 : $13.2 billion (5,774 EUs firm and 9,832 EUs options), up 7.0% year-over-year; ZEBs represent 35.1% of total backlog 1 EUs ROIC 1 : increased to 9.1%, up from 5.3% in 2024 Q3 Liquidity 1 : $386.0 million, a 169.0% increase from 2024 Q3 Key financial metrics for 2025 Q3 are included in the table below: in millions except deliveries and per share amounts 2025 Q3 2024 Q3 2025 Q3 LTM 2024 Q3 LTM Deliveries (EUs) 1,114 994 4,398 4,594 IFRS Measures Revenue $ 879.9 $ 711.3 $ 3,426.4 $ 3,082.0 Net loss $ (140.9 ) $ (15.0 ) $ (289.5 ) $ (24.2 ) Net loss per share $ (1.18 ) $ (0.13 ) $ (2.43 ) $ (0.20 ) Net cash generated (used) by operating activities $ 83.9 $ (45.2 ) $ 72.6 $ 53.0 Non-IFRS Measures Adjusted EBITDA 1 $ 80.9 $ 53.2 $ 282.4 $ 185.0 Adjusted Net Earnings 1 $ 12.1 $ (4.8 ) $ 39.7 $ (23.2 ) Adjusted Net Earnings per Share 1 $ 0.10 $ (0.04 ) $ 0.33 $ (0.20 ) Free Cash Flow 1 $ 14.8 $ 2.0 $ 35.5 $ (15.7 ) Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) 1 9.1 % 3.5 % 9.1 % 3.5 % CEO Comments \"The third quarter saw improvements in delivery performance with improved revenue and expanded margins per unit delivered as we converted our stronger backlog into results. These operational gains translated into significant growth in Adjusted EBITDA and Free Cash Flow reinforcing our continued focus on deleveraging and growing liquidity,\u201d said Paul Soubry, President and Chief Executive Officer, NFI. \u201cThese positives were partially offset by warranty charges related to a battery recall and associated support costs. We are in detailed discussions with the supplier who provides those systems and expect to reach an agreement on recall costs as we move through the fourth quarter.\u201d \u201cWe continued to drive performance enhancements to our supply chain, including a joint venture investment to take over the assets of American Seating. We feel this joint venture will stabilize and enhance operations, ensuring more consistent supply for their customers, including NFI, and the millions of riders who use those seats every day.\u201d \u201cOur aftermarket business remained a strong contributor, even as quarterly margins were impacted by lower contribution from retrofit programs. We see opportunities for improved performance in that segment as it executes on several growth-related initiatives and fully reflect tariff impacts within its pricing models. The tariff environment continues to evolve, with a new tariff coming into effect on November 1 st . We are working closely with suppliers and customers to ensure our pricing reflects these latest developments and continue to view tariffs primarily as pass-through costs, although private motor coach demand may be impacted.\u201d \u201cGiven our year-to-date performance we\u2019ve narrowed our 2025 guidance ranges and remain confident in our ability to deliver strong revenue and margin growth in the fourth quarter. We expect this momentum will result in NFI recording it\u2019s highest quarterly Adjusted EBITDA performance in Company history,\u201d Soubry concluded. 2025 North American Battery Recall During the quarter, NFI initiated a voluntary recall with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and Transport Canada. The recall impacted approximately 700 battery-electric buses and coaches (primarily New Flyer buses) equipped with certain battery modules from a common supplier, XALT Energy, LLC (referred to as XALT). After issuing the recall, NFI deployed operational guidelines and software to limit the state of charge and s",

The vote is scheduled for Thursday and will determine whether Musk secures what is the largest compensation package in corporate history.

These firms often influence large passive funds that hold significant stakes in the electric carmaker. Tesla has faced mounting challenges this year, with global sales declining and investor confidence wavering. In July, Tesla reported a 13.5 percent decline in sales in the United States. They jumped 7.4 percent in the third quarter ending in September compared with the same period the year before, as US consumers scrambled to take advantage of a $7,500 EV tax credit that was set to expire that month. However, global sales are also on the decline. New car registrations fell by 89 percent in Sweden, 31 percent in Spain, and 59 percent in neighbouring Portugal in October. Political activity hurt Tesla brand That tension is compounded by Musk\u2019s political profile. A former ally of US President Donald Trump, he was appointed head of the Department of Government Efficiency, where he advocated for sweeping layoffs across the federal workforce, the largest employer in the US. Musk\u2019s political activity has hurt Tesla\u2019s brand while boosting its competitors. Between October 2022 and April 2025, sales of other electric and hybrid cars rose by 22 percent, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research. The study estimated that if Musk had stayed out of politics, Tesla\u2019s sales could have been higher by 67 percent to 83 percent \u2014 equivalent to roughly 1 million to 1.26 million additional vehicles. Advertisement Despite these headwinds, Tesla board Chair Robyn Denholm has warned that rejecting the pay package could risk Musk\u2019s departure. In a letter to shareholders last week, she said Musk\u2019s leadership \u201cis critical to the brand\u2019s success\u201d. Analysts agree that Tesla\u2019s future depends on Musk\u2019s continued involvement. \u201cIt\u2019s a watershed moment that we expect Musk to get the pay package by a wide margin. Musk is key to Tesla\u2019s AI ambitions. Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk,\u201d Dan Ives, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, told Al Jazeera. \u201cMusk is a wartime CEO, and no one else will ever fill his shoes at Tesla. [This is the] most important chapter of growth for Tesla ever with the AI Revolution, despite Musk\u2019s political baggage.\u201d Tesla has doubled down on investments in AI technology. It is building out what it calls its Optimus humanoid robot technology, which the company hopes to launch late next year. Performance metrics Musk\u2019s pay package hinges on his performance . It includes 12 ambitious market-cap targets, requiring the company to reach $8.5 trillion in valuation within a decade, starting with $2 trillion. Tesla\u2019s market cap is at $1.48 trillion at the moment, The performance metrics also include 20 million vehicle deliveries, 1 million AI bot sales, and 1 million driverless robotaxis over that period, with deliveries taking place on all fronts for three consecutive months. Last year, the company sold just less than 2 million vehicles. Musk earns additional shares as each milestone is met. He must also remain CEO or hold another executive-level role over the course of the 10-year programme. Critics argue th",

Reports Strong Q3 2025 Financial Results, Confirms 2025 Earnings Guidance November 05, 2025 07:05 ET | Source: Avista Corporation Avista Corporation Strong third quarter financial results reflect the benefits of general rate cases and disciplined cost management. Affirming earnings guidance, with Avista Utilities expected to deliver earnings at the upper end of its range and consolidated results anticipated to be near the lower end of the range. 2025 RFP shortlist selected, including Avista ownership options. SPOKANE, Wash., Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Avista Corp. ( NYSE: AVA ) today reported third quarter 2025 financial results. Third quarter net income rose to $0.36 per diluted share in 2025, up from $0.23 per diluted share in Q3 2024. Year-to-date net income increased to $1.51 per diluted share, compared to $1.44 per diluted share for the same period last year. These results were driven by strong operational execution, constructive regulatory outcomes, customer load growth, and disciplined cost management. The table below provides details on net income and earnings per diluted share for the third quarter and year-to-date 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024 (dollars in millions, except per-share data): Third Quarter Year-to-Date 2025 2024 2025 2024 Net Income (Loss) by: Reportable Segments Avista Utilities $ 30 $ 20 $ 131 $ 111 AEL&P \u2014 \u2014 4 5 Other non-reportable segment loss (1 ) (2 ) (13 ) (3 ) Total net income $ 29 $ 18 $ 122 $ 113 Earnings (Loss) per Diluted Share: Reportable Segments Avista Utilities $ 0.38 $ 0.25 $ 1.63 $ 1.42 AEL&P (0.01 ) \u2014 0.04 0.06 Other non-reportable segment loss (0.01 ) (0.02 ) (0.16 ) (0.04 ) Total earnings per diluted share $ 0.36 $ 0.23 $ 1.51 $ 1.44 CEO Perspective \u201cOur third-quarter results demonstrate the success of our strategic execution. We continue to advance our key initiatives, including working through next steps with the promising projects shortlisted in our 2025 RFP, and developing plans for expanded service to existing industrial customers within our service territory. We are committed to the strength of our core utility as we maintain our focus on delivering reliable service, investing in our communities and creating enduring value for our shareholders,\u201d said Heather Rosentrater, President and CEO of Avista. Analysis of 2025 Consolidated Earnings The following table presents the changes in net income and diluted earnings per share for the third quarter and year-to-date 2025 compared to the same periods in 2024. It also outlines the various after-tax factors that contributed to these changes (dollars in millions, except per-share data): Third Quarter Year-to-Date Net Income (a) Earnings per Share Net Income (a) Earnings per Share 2024 consolidated earnings $ 18 $ 0.23 $ 113 $ 1.44 Changes in net income and diluted earnings per share: Avista Utilities Electric utility margin (b) 26 0.32 68 0.84 Natural gas utility margin (c) 3 0.04 15 0.19 Other operating expenses (d) (14 ) (0.17 ) (38 ) (0.47 ) Depreciation and amortization (e) (5 ) (0.05 ) (10 ) (0.12 ) Interest expense (1 ) (0.02 ) (2 ) (0.03 ) Other 1 0.02 (4 ) (0.05 ) Income tax at effective rate (f) \u2014 \u2014 (9 ) (0.11 ) Dilution on earnings n/a (0.01 ) n/a (0.04 ) Total Avista Utilities 10 0.13 20 0.21 AEL&P earnings \u2014 (0.01 ) (1 ) (0.02 ) Other businesses earnings (g) 1 0.01 (10 ) (0.12 ) 2025 consolidated earnings $ 29 $ 0.36 $ 122 $ 1.51 (a) The tax impact of each line item was calculated using Avista Corp.'s federal statutory tax rate of 21%. (b) Electric utility margin increased as a result of general rate cases, customer growth and non-decoupled load growth. The Energy Recovery Mechanism (ERM) resulted in a $13 million pre-tax expense for the first three quarters of 2025, compared to an $8 million pre-tax expense in the same period in 2024. (c) Natural gas utility margin increased primarily due to the effects of our general rate cases and customer growth. (d) Other operating expenses increased due to increased employee salaries and benefits costs, as well as thermal generation costs. In addition, net amortizations and deferrals associated with wildfire mitigation and insurance costs have increased, with corresponding increases to revenue which result in no impact to earnings. The increases in net amortizations and deferrals represent approximately one quarter of the increase in year-to-date other operating expenses. (e) Depreciation and amortization increased due to additions to utility plant. (f) Our effective tax rate in the first three quarters of 2025 was 11% compared to 2% in the prior year. The change is primarily due to a decrease in tax customer credits as the majority of the tax customer credits have been returned to customers. We expect our effective tax rate to be 11% for 2025.

Read Today's Paper Time for India to have a comprehensive gold policy: SBI study SECTIONS Time for India to have a comprehensive gold policy: SBI study PTI Last Updated: Nov 05, 2025, 04:50:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Gold prices are reaching new heights. A new study calls for a dedicated long-term gold policy in India. The country is a major gold market, driven by culture and investment. India imports most of its gold. The study suggests a comprehensive approach to manage gold's role in the economy. This policy could integrate with financial reforms. ANI As gold prices soar to new heights, a study on Wednesday made a case for a comprehensive policy for the yellow metal as India is one of the world's largest bullion markets, influenced by a cultural affinity for the shiny metal and investment demand. Gold price has been reaching new heights driven by geo-political tensions, economic uncertainty, and a weakening US dollar, said the report titled 'Coming Of (A Turbulent) Age: The Great Global Gold Rush' by the State Bank of India 's Economic Research Department. The year-to-date price has increased by over 50 per cent in 2025. The price came down to below USD 4,000 per ounce for a few days in October, but again moved above USD 4,000/oz in November. The report noted that the domestic supply of gold is only a fraction of the total gold supply in India, with imports contributing around 86 per cent of the total supply in 2024 as per the World Gold Council estimate. India is one of the largest gold markets, influenced by cultural affinity for shiny metal, investment demand and other economic factors, including a hedge against inflation and a safe-haven asset, it noted. Live Events Total consumer demand for gold in India increased to 802.8 tonnes in 2024, which was 26 per cent of the global gold demand , placing India at second rank, next to China with a consumer demand of 815.4 tonnes. \"Cherished by households, cheered by investors, hoarded by central banks and feted by speculators, the recent chequered journey of the shiny metal has been straight out of a story book, but also cautions as a fear gauge of the tempest waiting on the sidelines. Time for India to have a dedicated long-term gold policy that supports localisation,\" the report said. It said the gold price has a direct impact on the USD INR exchange rate too, owing to the country's huge dependence on gold imports. The two are highly correlated, around 0.73, implying that higher gold prices are associated with Indian rupee depreciation, though the average import quantum makes it not a too significant factor. SBI study said China has a national policy on gold, which has a specific purpose. It has a comprehensive approach to reshaping how gold is traded, stored, valued, and used in international commerce. It represents a coordinated approach to addressing several economic and geopolitical priorities simultaneously. On India's gold policy till now, it said, \"if one were to take an objective view of the policy discussions on gold since 1978, one finds that the major thrust has been to wean away the masses from physical gold. They were therefore only short-term in horizon\". \"The time has now come to conceive a comprehensive policy on gold, and for such it is important that one defines what gold is (commodity or money) and how gold is perceived by its ultimate consumer,\" the report said. The present trends in respect of gold policy prominently include demand-reducing measures and recycling of existing gold stock for productive purposes, it said. However, since gold c",

The devil had nothing to do and\u2026was cursing his own children, as the paraphrased proverb goes. Anyway, it was certain that that poor CEO of ELTA would pay the price, and equally certain that the opposition would focus so much on an issue like ELTA, which probably doesn\u2019t concern anyone except MPs. The opposition, because they don\u2019t know how to find something more serious and substantive among the dozens of issues in everyday life, and the government side, because the MPs are simply upset that Mitsotakis isn\u2019t appointing them as ministers. You might say they\u2019re not wrong\u2014every MP aims for a ministerial post during their party\u2019s time in government. That\u2019s true, but honestly, if they think they\u2019ll gain votes for fighting to keep the ELTA offices in\u2026Kolopetinitsa open, they\u2019re probably confused. The conclusion\u2026 We\u2019ve said again that the handling of ELTA is the ultimate case study in repeated government mismanagement. And the massive \u201cblack hole\u201d of daily management issues that M.M. [Kyriakos Mitsotakis] apparently faces. Always considering that the second term, especially toward the end, is something like the seven years of itch in marriages, making everything more difficult. On substance\u2026 Substantively, as we said, the CEO of ELTA paid the price. The plans to close provincial branches will be frozen, and Pierrakakis will take over after they find a new CEO, so that in 3\u20134 months, cuts can proceed without causing unnecessary fuss. In other words, they will leave some branches open in isolated villages or assign the work (how much work, one wonders?) to some community or small municipality, to a local shop where grandma can go to pay her bills or collect her pension if there\u2019s no ATM. I repeat: the government won\u2019t fall over issues like ELTA or the \u201cUnknown Soldier,\u201d but it certainly doesn\u2019t help in regaining the lost support of the New Democracy party, because there are voters who supported ND to be done with such issues, not to swallow them. Counterattack with taxes In this context, it\u2019s clear that M.M. wants to extricate himself from the ELTA discussion. A good platform is Pierrakakis\u2019 tax bill, which will pass through Parliament on Thursday. I hear Kyriakos Mitsotakis is considering going to speak (he\u2019ll decide today), while ND may request a roll-call vote to\u2026 watch the opposition reject positive measures. Tassoulas\u2019 impressions Kimberly Gilfoyle spent about an hour on the Presidential couch talking with Tassoulas, who does well in English, having worked at a law firm in London in the late \u201880s. I understand from a conversation with my source at the Presidential Palace that the ambassador left an excellent impression, as she knows her subjects well. She discussed energy issues, which will be central to her mission, with Tassoulas and Alexandra Papadopoulou, and they also touched on Greek-Turkish relations. Tassoulas reportedly told his associates afterward that the ambassador came informed and battle-ready, which is entirely positive. M.M. and the reception Regarding Ms. Gilfoyle\u2019s schedule today, she will visit M.M. twice: once around 10:00 to meet K.M. on Greek soil, whom she had met in New York, and again in the afternoon with ministers Doug Bergam and Chris Wright, who are coming for the major energy forum P-TEC starting at Zappeion on Thursday. To honor the American officials, Ms. Gilfoyle is also hosting her first reception of the era at Jefferson House tonight, with guests including forum participants arriving in Athens that evening, shipping and energy sector figures, and many ministers. A quick glance suggests that Papastavrou and Tsafos, the Greek hosts of the conference, Pierrakakis, Kerameos, Theodorikakos, Kikilias, Adonis, and several other Greek government figures are expected to attend. Peletidis the giant Moving to Patras, where KKE Mayor Peletidis, after receiving bank sponsorships under the state \u201cMarietta Yannakou\u201d program for improving and reconstructing school buildings, removed the plaques acknowledging the sponsors. He made a statement typical of communist rhetoric: \u201cToday we proceeded to remove the plaques that promote",

In response, Claudio Rojas, CEO of the National Angel Capital Organization issued the following statement: \u201cWe\u2019re pleased to see meaningful progress in areas that reflect NACO\u2019s long-standing recommendations. This budget takes important steps toward aligning policy with the realities of early-stage entrepreneurs. We look forward to continuing to work with the government on advancing capital formation and leveraging our national network to develop a powerful strategy that fortifies Canada\u2019s angel capital infrastructure.\u201d Claudio Rojas, CEO of National Angel Capital Organization at NACO Summit 2025 in Ottawa Access to Capital and Networks: In alignment with NACO\u2019s recommendations, Budget 2025 announced the government\u2019s \u201cintention to develop a strategy to support Canadian firms facing early growth-stage funding gaps\u201d through $750 million in support of Canada\u2019s early-stage entrepreneurs and the networks that fund them. \u201cThis $750 million announcement is a timely and strategic investment in Canada\u2019s angel infrastructure. It recognizes that when we support the networks and investors behind early-stage companies, we strengthen the entire innovation economy.\u201d Budget 2025 also announced the launch of a new fund-of-funds program, \u201cVenture and Growth Capital Catalyst Initiative (VGCCI)\u201d, a $1 billion investment that will extend the impact of VCAP and VCCI, as well as fortify the capital pipeline at the later stage. This initiative is expected to leverage more private venture capital by incentivizing pension funds and other institutional investor participation, and will support new and emerging fund managers and important sectors such as life sciences. With the announcement of these programs, it is clear that Canada is moving forward with a more sophisticated understanding of how capital at all stages transforms innovation into commercialization. With end-to-end investment from the earliest stages \u2013 including both capital and networks \u2013 to the latest stages of private capital, Canada will fuel a nation of builders with the capital they need to compete globally. Federal Budget 2025 Defence Innovation, Dual-Use, and Strategic Sectors Further, NACO commends the Government on its efforts to prioritize defence innovation, dual-use, artificial intelligence, quantum, and other strategic and frontier sectors as part of the forthcoming Defence Industrial Strategy. Programs under this strategy include $656.9M, starting 2025-26, for ISED to develop and commercialize dual-use technologies in a range of sectors, and $334.3 million over five years to help quantum technology companies grow in Canada. NACO also commends the government\u2019s investment of $925.6 million over five years to build a large-scale sovereign compute capacity. Summary This budget reflects meaningful movement toward the priorities NACO has put forward to build Canada\u2019s innovation ecosystem, as most recently reinforced in NACO's submissions to the Standing Committee on Finance. The inclusion of targeted initiatives aimed at supporting early-stage companies signals a welcome shift in the national conversation. NACO remains committed to working with government and ecosystem partners to advance the next generation of tools \u2014 including implementing a National Investment Tax Credit to increase supply of capital, and strengthening Canada\u2019s angel infrastructure under the $750 million to address early-stage funding gaps. \u201cTaking a sophisticated and comprehensive approach to capital formation and access to capital will ensure our nation\u2019s entrepreneurs have the resources they need to scale into global markets and compete alongside the world\u2019s fastest growing companies,\u201d said Claudio Rojas, CEO of National Angel Capital Organization. \u201cBy increasing capital formation at the earliest stages, we can put Canada at the forefront and make our country a leader in innovation.\u201d About NACO Founded in 2002, the National Angel Capital Organization (NACO) represents more than 4,000 angel investors and over 100 member organizations across Canada. Collectively, NACO members have invested more than $1.8 billion in over 2,000 Canadian ventures\u2014fueling innovation, job creation, and economic resilience nationwide.

Countless Indians are left without reliable income as they age. There\u2019s a growing call for authorities to introduce alternative financial products aimed at delivering consistent, inflation-protected earnings for non-pensioners. Such initiatives could pave the way for a respectful and secure retirement, driven by individuals' own financial strategies. Mythili Bhusnurmath ET Now Consulting Editor We still have time to fix this Mid-October, tucked away in a corner of most dailies was a report that should have got far more prominence than it did, considering it affects close to 104 mn Indians, or a little over 10% of the population. 'Mercer CFA Institute Global Pension Index 2025' paints a bleak picture of India's pension system, which ranks among the worst in the world. Along with Turkiye, Argentina and the Philippines, the report awarded India an inglorious 'D' for showing 'major weaknesses that need urgent attention'. At 43.8, India's pension index in 2025 compares poorly not only with the likes of the Netherlands, which leads the table with an index of 85.4, but also with Indonesia (51), Malaysia (61) and Mexico (69), with an average of 64.5. In a scenario where India's 'demographic dividend' is fast ceasing to be so, and the number of senior citizens is growing almost exponentially, old-age income security remains a distant dream for most citizens. This includes not only those at the bottom of the pyramid, but increasingly those in the middle and upper-middle classes as well, who have not had access to a suitable pension product during their working years to help them manage their post-retirement life. Pensions were a luxury reserved initially only for government, and later for PSU, employees. It is no surprise that a 2024 NITI Aayog paper, 'Senior Care Reforms in India: Reimagining the Senior Care Paradigm', noted that 78% of the elderly live without any pension. The Mercer report evaluated 52 countries on three abilities of the system: Adequacy (40%): To provide individuals with confidence that their retirement income will be sufficient for them to live a dignified retirement. Sustainability (35%): To withstand demographic and economic pressures over time to keep delivering benefits. Integrity (25%): To uphold long-term stability and reliability of regulatory frameworks that safeguard these promises. Unsurprisingly, in a country where old-age security is virtually non-existent except for government and PSU employees, India fared poorly on all three parameters. It scored a lowly 'E' on adequacy, and 'D' and 'C' on sustainability and integrity, respectively. Notably, India is the only country among the 52 in the sample to be awarded an 'E' on adequacy. Mirroring low coverage of pensions, ratio of pension assets-to-GDP is also low - 21% of GDP, according to Economic Survey 2024-25, in contrast to over 80% in OECD countries. In a country critically short of infra - and, hence, of long-term infra finance of the kind best provided by pension and insurance funds - we are reportedly still trying to fund infra development through bank loans. The net result: asset-liability mismatches, made worse by prolonged delays in completion of infra projects, given the attendant political-economy issues that are part and parcel of infra development in any democracy. Recall the crisis during the early part of this century, when banks' exposure to infra led to huge NPAs, and the role of pension funds is self-evident. Today, we have a nascent pension industry, thanks to NPS and Atal Pension Yojana. We also have a regulator in Pension Fund Regulatory and Development Authority (PFRDA). But NPS coverage is less than 5% of the workforce. Also, assuming an individual joins the workforce at 20 and works till 60, the first non-government beneficiary under NPS (which was extended to the ",

By Madison McLauchlan , Alex Riehl , Jon Fingas and Douglas Soltys November 4, 2025 Email Share on LinkedIn Share on X Share on Reddit Share on BlueSky Finance Minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne unveils the 2025 federal budget. Feds make huge spending commitments but finally get competitive on defence, taxes, and financial services. Jim Balsillie, chair of the Council of Canadian Innovators (CCI) and former co-CEO of Research in Motion, has called it \u201cthe most important budget\u201d of his lifetime. \u201cThis is a message to all the entrepreneurs, to startup businesses across the country. Canada will be the most competitive country, and we are making sure we empower you to do that.\u201d Finance minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne Budget 2025 is a collection of firsts: Canada\u2019s first fiscal update since a trade war broke out with the United States, and the first budget from a revamped Liberal party led by Prime Minister Mark Carney. As experts warn of faltering productivity, the stakes are high for this budget to protect Canada\u2019s economic sovereignty while limiting its vulnerability to an unpredictable trade partner. The feds\u2019 response? Promising one trillion dollars in new investments over the next five years; a $78.3-billion deficit for 2025-26; and major commitments across AI, quantum, venture capital programs, financial services innovation, and\u2014perhaps most importantly\u2014defence. \u201cToday, we\u2019re delivering an investment budget,\u201d Finance minister Fran\u00e7ois-Philippe Champagne told the assembled press gallery at the budget lockup. \u201cThe kind of budget that will make Canada more resilient, more prosperous\u2026that will make Canada the strongest economy in the G7.\u201d \u201cThis is a message to all the entrepreneurs, to startup businesses across the country. Canada will be the most competitive country, and we are making sure we empower you to do that.\u201d It\u2019s unclear yet if that message will resonate with entrepreneurs. Dan Kelly, president of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB), said in a statement, \u201cSmall firms have learned the hard way that today\u2019s deficits are tomorrow\u2019s taxes.\u201d There are also outstanding political questions. In recent weeks, Liberal leaders have publicly worried about their ability to pass the budget with a minority government. In Montr\u00e9al, AI minister Evan Solomon said he plans to table AI and privacy laws, but cautioned that \u201cminority governments have their own climate.\u201d While an election might seem an unlikely result of Budget 2025, last year\u2019s Fall Economic Statement and its resulting election should be a lesson to all Canadians that nothing is guaranteed. But back to the budget proper. Here\u2019s a look at what Canadian tech expected, what it got, and how it\u2019s reacting. Defence Tech SUMMARY IN-DEPTH Financial Innovation SUMMARY IN-DEPTH AI and Quantum SUMMARY IN-DEPTH Tax Credits SUMMARY IN-DEPTH Procurement and IP SUMMARY IN-DEPTH Venture Capital SUMMARY IN-DEPTH Executive Summary Defence $17.9 billion over five years to expand military capabilities, including counter-drone operations $10.9 billion over five years to upgrade digital infrastructure at DND, CAF, and CSE, including cyber defence $1 billion over four years for an Arctic Infrastructure Fund investing in dual-use Northern transportation infrastructure projects $6.6 billion for the Defence Industrial Strategy, including: $1 billion to create a Defence and Security Business Mobilization Program at BDC for defence tech loans and investments $334.3 million to help \u201canchor\u201d quantum companies in Canada and help with defence-related adoption $68.2 million over three years to establish the Bureau of Research, Engineering and Advanced Leadership in Innovation and Science (BOREALIS) $656.9 million over five years for ISED to develop dual-use technologies across industries $182.6 million over three years to forge sovereign space launch capability $443.0 million over five years to Natural Resources Canada and ISED to support the development of innovative critical minerals processing technologies $30.8 million over four years ($7.7 million ongoing) to establish the Defence Investment Agency to consolidate, focus, and accelerate procurement for very large ($100 million or more) projects Open Banking and Stablecoins Legislative commitment to improve open banking by: Completing the Consumer-Driven Banking Act Adding a data-mobility right to PIPEDA The Bank of Canada will now oversee open banking, taking over from the FCAC $25.7 million over five years ($5 million ongoing) for CSIS and t",

You can stream and download our full conversation, including any podcast extras, on Apple Podcasts , Spotify , YouTube , and Bloomberg . All of our earlier podcasts on your favorite pod hosts can be found here . ~~~ This is Masters in Business with Barry Ritholtz on Bloomberg Radio. Barry Ritholtz : This week on the podcast, another extra special guest, John Hilson Wrath, was a reporter for the Wall Street Journal, covering everything from September 11th to the Federal Reserve for 26 years. His coverage at, at the Journal of the Fed got him nicknamed the Fed Whisperer for his many, many page one scoops. He\u2019s now running Serpa Pinto Advisory, multiple pulitz surprise nomination, author of a book about Janet Yellen. Just a whirlwind of information about the economy, markets and the Fed. I thought the conversation was absolutely fascinating, and I think you will also, with no further ado, my conversation with the Wall Street Journals, Jon Hilsenrath. Jon Hilsenrath : It is my extra special honor to be here. Barry Ritholtz : Does it, does it feel like you\u2019re in the enemy\u2019s territory? Competitive? Jon Hilsenrath : No, I\u2019ve crossed over, I\u2019ve crossed over. Barry Ritholtz : You\u2019re now on the private side, right? Jon Hilsenrath : Yeah, yeah. I\u2019m, yeah. Yeah. So I want to talk and I, I, I should say on the Wall Street Journal page one story is, I\u2019m a former editor too. I had that many, I don\u2019t have that many anymore. \u2019cause I\u2019ve, I left the journal well, years ago\u2026 Barry Ritholtz : But those, those headlines, so like, that Jon Hilsenrath : Number isn\u2019t growing anymore. Barry Ritholtz : Right. But it\u2019s it, but it\u2019s not going down either. That number is true. A prominent record. That\u2019s true. Yeah. I appreciate that. So you appreciate that you, you have that many, you know, that many poll positions and you\u2019re, you\u2019re good to go. Jon Hilsenrath : And there were that many battles with editors at the Wall Street Journal over how structure that story and what headline to put on it. Barry Ritholtz : That\u2019s a whole nother conversation we\u2019re gonna get to. Yeah. I, I am constantly reminding people, Hey, you know, the writer, they don\u2019t get to pick the headline. That\u2019s the editor. And people seem shocked by that. Jon Hilsenrath : Yeah. It\u2019s a process. Let\u2019s just, let\u2019s say that to say the very least, say that. It\u2019s definitely a process. Barry Ritholtz : Before we get to your writing and editing, let\u2019s talk a little bit about your background. Duke University undergrad, eventually an MBA from Columbia. What was the career plan? Jon Hilsenrath : The career plan for me was always journalism. I, I actually like you, I\u2019m a Long Island boy. Are you from Long Island or\u2026 Barry Ritholtz : From sixth grade on, from Plainview, Jon Hilsenrath : I grew, I grew up there. Where? What town? Manhasset? Long Island. Barry Ritholtz : That\u2019s, we could play Jewish geography. That\u2019s 15, 20 minutes from me. Jon Hilsenrath : Although Manhasset was a Catholic town, but yes, very much so. I, but like, the career plan for me was always journalism. I started writing for the Manhasset Press when I was 16 years old. I was, I started out as a sports writer. The original plan was sports writer. Ah, and then the, the next plan was war correspondent. And then somehow I ended up becoming an economics writer. But I stuck to the plan of journalism. Barry Ritholtz : So if journalism was always the plan, why an MBA, why not a journalism degree? Jon Hilsenrath : Well, so I about, excuse me, about five years into my journalism career, I went back and did a fellow, I, when I decided I wanted to do economics in finance, I went back and did a fellowship at Columbia. It was called a Knight Bagehot Fellowship. Yep. Great program. And what they did is they took a few working journalists, and then they put them through the business school for a year. That\u2019s interesting. And then after a year of that, I decided to do a few extra courses and, and get the MBA. But I was really there for the fellowship to kind of, to, basically what I wanted to do was learn how a balance sheet worked. Right. You know, learn how corporate finance worked. I had spent a bunch of years covering like macro, but I didn\u2019t understand anything about what made Wall Street go. So that was why I went back there. Barry Ritholtz : So what was it that drew you to journalism? Jon Hilsenrath : Oh, wow. I just, you know, so I hated English class in high school. I don\u2019t know how you felt, but, but you know, these four, and they\u2019re still teaching it the same way, by the way. Right.

From: HM Treasury and The Rt Hon Rachel Reeves MP Published 4 November 2025 Delivered on: 4 November 2025 (Transcript of the speech, exactly as it was delivered) Later this month, I will deliver my second Budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer. At that Budget, I will make the choices necessary to deliver strong foundations for our economy. My Budget led by this government\u2019s values of fairness and opportunity\u2026 \u2026and focused entirely on the priorities of the British people: Protecting our NHS, reducing our national debt, and improving the cost of living. There is a lot of speculation about the choices that I will make. I understand that \u2013 these are the important choices that will shape the future of our country for years to come I want people to understand the circumstances we are facing, the principles guiding my choices, and why I believe they will be the right choices for our country. We are a country with considerable economic strengths: An open, trading economy, A global hub for cutting-edge industries from AI to Biotech, With world-leading universities and scientific institutions, and a talented and a committed workforce. [political redaction] At the Budget last year, I fixed the foundations: [political redaction] I put the public finances back on a firm footing, Provided an urgent cash injection into our faltering public services, And began rebuilding our economy. But since that Budget, The world has thrown even more challenges our way. The continual threat of tariffs has dragged on global confidence - Deterring business investment, and dampening growth. Inflation has been too slow to come down as supply chains continue to be volatile - Meaning that the cost of everyday essentials remains too high. And the cost of government borrowing has increased around the world - A shift that Britain \u2013 [political redaction] \u2013 has been particularly exposed to. And in an uncertain world, we also face pressure to increase our defence spending \u2013 and it is right that we do that\u2026 \u2026protecting ourselves from hostile actors and supporting our allies. And there are other pressures on the public finances. The Prime Minister, the Secretary of Work and Pensions and this whole government are committed to reforming our welfare state\u2026 \u2026so that it is not a system that counts the cost of failure\u2026 \u2026but one that invests in success and protects those who need it most. There is nothing progressive about refusing to reform a system that is leaving one in eight young people out of education or employment. So, we have begun the job of creating a system that protects people who cannot work and empowers those who can. And there are longer-term challenges too: That feeling, shared by millions of people across the country that the economy isn\u2019t working as it should. Alongside the Budget this month, The Office for Budget Responsibility \u2013 the UK\u2019s public finance watchdog - will set out the conclusions of their review of the supply side of the UK economy. I will not pre-empt those conclusions\u2026 \u2026but it is already clear that the productivity performance [political redaction] is weaker than previously thought. A less productive economy is one that produces less output per hour worked. That has consequences for working people \u2013 for the",

About 50 blue MPs yesterday, then, in a teleconference in which the minister of Digital Policy participated \u2014 I was grazing the sheep over here a bit further away \u2014 and one miserable CEO (ELTA) named SkliKas, became the punching bag. Whatever resentment provincial MPs had against M.M and the government, they took it out on a \u2014 in my view \u2014 kinda ridiculous subject. As if they don\u2019t know ELTA has been dead for a long time and all that is needed is careful communication handling. Neither the postmen will disappear from the villages nor grandmas will not be able to pay electricity. We said these also yesterday, but you see, six years of governing without ministry is a lot for a majority MP. And especially when it\u2019s possible he may not be reelected in his constituency \u2014 what, he should learn another trade now in old age than the\u2026 bluff of politics! So, to finish, ELTA should have been modernized ten years ago and not be paid gold until today. Basically, when there was interest, the State should have unloaded them. Even Petsas is shouting today because, he says, the post office in Dionysos will shut! And the ministers\u2026disappeared! But sorry, for ministers also to disappear and not withstand a clash with society (the spoiled side of it) or with their fellow MPs is not very honorable. Moral: The government six years now succeeded in many things and achieved quite serious reforms. When, though, the time of clash came on a subject, it always stepped back. Only on gay couples it didn\u2019t step back \u2014 and of course paid for it dearly. Well then, write it down: if you see ELTA really closing, hang bells on me. Hatzidakis Hatzidakis yesterday had a discussion, I\u2019m told, with K.M and complained heavily that they load on him always the dirty work. Well that\u2019s why he went there \u2014 so the prime minister doesn\u2019t pay. I think that, generally, 2025 is not 2019 and Maximos is a different thing. So, it needs different design \u2014 but these are their problems. What the truth is Now, to understand how\u2026 far this whole thing is from reality, see what applies today for ELTA services and will continue to apply and what they intend to change. A simple reading of this text proves that this is a colossal communication blunder or incompetence of ELTA management, that they never \u201cshouted\u201d these things, so that everyone understands that neither the postmen who serve are being fired, nor the shops are closing and not replaced. Which exact services are done now in the stores and which by the physical postman at home. Services performed within stores Posting and receiving postal items and parcels Bill collection (DEI, EYDAP etc.) and fast payments Pension Account transactions (withdrawals, deposits) Issuance and redemption of postal money orders Banking transactions and Western Union 1,2,3 are performed by the carrier at the citizen\u2019s door today. 4 is a matter of system extension and 5 can be implemented after changes in the institutional framework. Mountain villages and islands How do we ensure citizens in remote areas \u2013 especially islands and mountainous \u2013 will not be left without physical store until the new structure is fully operational \u2022 Already 92% of pensions and 90% of postal items are delivered at home by postmen. \u2022 No area without access \u2013 service via rural postmen, home services and cooperating agents. \u2022 Deliveries with knowledge of local communities \u2013 continuity of service without interruption. \u2022 Phase B of plan \u2013 gradual implementation with full information to citizens for alternative solutions. \u2022 No interruption of service \u2013 continuity via postmen, agents, supermarkets and home services. OPEKEPE \u2013 Commission For OPEKEPE you know grosso modo. Today the Greek plan will be submitted to the Commission, which in reality has been shaped in agreement with Brussels. The Commissioners will now study it for a few days and more (positive news) we will hear on Thursday, when the competent Commissioner Christoph Hansen comes to our places.

On Monday, Amazon announced that it had signed a $38 billion deal with OpenAI , offering the ChatGPT maker access to Amazon Web Services' infrastructure. On the one hand, the move isn't too surprising \u2014 a continuation of OpenAI's spending spree as it looks to secure resources to run its power-hungry artificial intelligence models. On the other, OpenAI's turn to Amazon shows that the firm is diversifying from its reliance on Microsoft , which had been its exclusive cloud services provider until this year. That could suggest OpenAI is getting ready for an initial public offering as it looks to signal \"both independence and operational maturity,\" as CNBC's MacKenzie Sigalos writes . Amazon shares surged on the news to close at a record high. Nvidia also had a positive day after Microsoft announced it was granted a license by the U.S. government to export the AI darling's chips to the United Arab Emirates.

Fiscal Year Highlights Fiscal year Diluted EPS of $6.02 and Adjusted EPS of $7.25, which represents a 3% increase in Adjusted EPS year-over-year Fiscal year segment EBIT decreased 5% in Reinforcement Materials and increased 18% in Performance Chemicals year-over-year Fiscal year 2025 Cash Flows from Operations of $665 million enabled capital investments of $274 million and the payment of $96 million in dividends and $168 million in share repurchases during the fiscal year Announced agreement to acquire Bridgestone Corporation\u2019s reinforcing carbons plant in Mexico Fourth Quarter Highlights Fourth Quarter Diluted EPS of $0.79 and Adjusted EPS of $1.70, which represents a 6% decrease in Adjusted EPS year-over-year Cash Flows from Operations of $219 million in the fourth fiscal quarter supported the return of $64 million of cash to shareholders in the quarter through a combination of share repurchases and dividends Released 2024 Sustainability Report and achieved 11 out of 15 of our 2025 Sustainability Goals ahead of schedule; established 2030 Sustainability Goals (In millions, except per share amounts) Three Months Ended Fiscal Year Ended 9/30/25 9/30/24 9/30/25 9/30/24 Net sales and other operating revenues $ 899 $ 1,001 $ 3,713 $ 3,994 Net income (loss) attributable to Cabot Corporation $ 43 $ 137 $ 331 $ 380 Net earnings (loss) per share attributable to Cabot Corporation $ 0.79 $ 2.43 $ 6.02 $ 6.72 Less: Certain items after tax per share $ (0.91 ) $ 0.63 $ (1.23 ) $ (0.34 ) Adjusted EPS $ 1.70 $ 1.80 $ 7.25 $ 7.06 Sean Keohane, Cabot President and Chief Executive Officer commented: \"I am very pleased with another strong year of Adjusted EPS growth where we achieved $7.25, up 3% year over year, in a year with a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. This performance was driven by higher EBIT in our Performance Chemicals segment which increased 18% year over year, partially offset by EBIT in our Reinforcement Materials segment which declined 5%. We delivered a solid fourth quarter with Adjusted EPS of $1.70, consistent with our expectations and which represents a decrease of 6% over the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Our continued operational and commercial discipline along with strong execution allowed us to drive countermeasures to deliver earnings growth in a volatile economic environment.\u201d Keohane continued, \u201cStrong operating performance in the year resulted in the company generating $665 million in operating cash flow, which enabled us to continue to deliver on our capital allocation priorities. In addition, we paid $96 million in dividends, including a 5% increase announced in May, and we repurchased $168 million of shares of our common stock. Our balance sheet remains strong despite the challenging macroeconomic backdrop, with a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.2 times, which allows us to invest to grow the company while returning capital to shareholders.\u201d Financial Detail For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025, net income attributable to Cabot Corporation was $43 million ($0.79 per common share). Net income reflects an after-tax per share charge from certain items of $0.91. Adjusted EPS for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was $1.70 per share. Segment Results Reinforcement Materials \u2013 Fourth quarter fiscal 2025 EBIT in Reinforcement Materials decreased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. The decrease in EBIT was largely driven by lower volumes in the Americas and Asia Pacific, partially offset by lower costs from overall cost management and optimization efforts. Volumes in the Americas were impacted by lower production levels at our tire customers given the higher levels of tire imports from Asia into the region. Global and regional volume changes for Reinforcement Materials for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 as compared to the same quarter of the prior year are set forth in the table below: Fourth Quarter Year-over-Year Change Global Reinforcement Materials Volumes (5 %) Asia Pacific (6 %) Europe, Middle East, Africa 5 % Americas (7 %) Performance Chemicals \u2013 Fourth quarter fiscal 2025 EBIT in Performance Chemicals decreased by $2 million compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 primarily due to a 5% decrease in volumes, partially offset by lower costs. The lower volumes were primarily due to lower demand in Europe, particularly in construction-related applications, and the lower costs were primarily from overall cost management and optimization efforts.

    "content": "Not All RWA growth Is Real, And The Industry Knows It Ecosystem English News Indices In Depth Learn Podcasts About Aishwary Gupta Nov 03, 2025 Not all RWA growth is real, and the industry knows it Inflated dashboards don\u2019t build institutional trust. Only verifiable assets, regulatory clarity and real usage can power the RWA revolution. Listen 0:00 2114 Opinion COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED Opinion by: Aishwary Gupta, global head of payments and RWAs at Polygon Labs Most of the eye-popping RWA numbers making headlines are smoke and mirrors. Unless the industry course-corrects, it risks eroding the institutional trust it has spent years trying to build. Every week brings another announcement claiming billions in tokenized assets. When institutional investors request basic details, however, the answers become mysteriously vague. OpenAI was forced to distance itself from Robinhood\u2019s claim that it was offering access to tokenized stock, clarifying that this did not represent real equity in the company. In May 2025, the SEC charged Unicoin for misleading investors by overstating the value of tokenized real estate deals. From the continued double-counting problem to the opaque legal status of many tokens, it\u2019s clear that the RWA revolution still faces major roadblocks to achieving credibility. This is actively harmful to the institutional adoption everyone claims to want. The industry\u2019s obsession with vanity metrics undermines the very credibility that RWAs need, so the ecosystem can unlock the trillions of institutional capital waiting on the sidelines. The vanity metric industrial complex \u201cThe biggest risk today is assuming that a legal wrapper and a blockchain alone create value,\u201d Forbes cited Ian Balina, CEO of Token Metrics, as saying. \u201cWithout real composability, reliable secondary markets, and trusted custody, tokenized assets remain stuck in marketing decks rather than investment portfolios.\u201d Related: RWA platform enters new phase, expanding compliant access to onchain assets He\u2019s right. Treating numbers on dashboards as if they\u2019re all that matter is actively harmful. Every inflated claim makes it harder for legitimate projects to be taken seriously. When a pension fund\u2019s due diligence team can\u2019t distinguish between real deployments and phantom TVL, they aren\u2019t interested in picking the real one. They\u2019d rather walk away entirely. Blockchain\u2019s entire value proposition is transparency and verifiability. Yet here we are, asking institutions to trust numbers we can\u2019t (or won\u2019t) prove. Fixing the trust problem Chains that can\u2019t demonstrate verifiable activity or regulatory alignment aren\u2019t only putting their own users at risk, but also undermining the integrity of the entire blockchain ecosystem. They are inflating expectations and undermining trust in the whole concept of tokenization. To maintain momentum and bring the benefits of RWAs to fruition, we urgently require transparent, regulated deployments that align with actual adoption, rather than fabricated metrics. What does genuine RWA adoption look like? A good place to start is in Wyoming. In September, the Equality State launched America\u2019s first state-backed stablecoin, FRNT, with full regulatory approval and fully auditable reserves. Or look to Japan, where JPYC is emerging as a legally compliant yen stablecoin that\u2019s creating new demand for Japanese government bonds. These projects solve real payment problems. They\u2019re more than just dashboards with volume moving back and forth. RWA adoption also resembles the Philippines\u2019 initiative to put government budget records onchain , aiming to combat corruption and increase transparency in public spending. That kind of dashboard means millions of citizens can verify their government\u2019s financial records in real-time. That\u2019s adoption that matters. BlackRock's BUIDL fund is now over $1 billion in AUM. This fund brings institutional-grade money market funds onchain. Apollo\u2019s ACRED , meanwhile, is bringing blockchain efficiency to the operation of credit markets. These are regulated financial products with real capital and real users. Stripe\u2019s decision to integrate blockchain rails for global payments came about because they needed to leverage a chain based on actual transaction volume and reliability, not social media engagement. The transparency test Any blockchain claiming RWA leadership simply needs to show us the money. TVL numbers are too easy. Can you show us the regulatory approvals? Are the institutional partners willing to go on record? The transaction volumes that prove people are actually using these assets? Can we audit the smart contracts? Can we verify the reserves? Plenty of legitimate RWA work is happening across the ecosystem, but it risks being drowned out in hype unless we establish standards that show real adoption. The RWA revolution doesn\u2019t need hype to be exciting. Real adoption comes from a municipal bond issuance that saves a city 50 basis points. Or, from a cross-border payment that se",

PETALING JAYA: The proposal for the withdrawal age in the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) retirement account to be aligned with the minimum retirement age is meant to strengthen \u00adsavings adequacy, says the World Bank. It added that as highlighted by its previous analysis, gaining access to retirement savings prior to retirement could be problem\u00adatic and lead to savings being prematurely exhausted. \u201cWe note that in most countries, retirement savings are only accessed at retirement age. This is also important in the context of (non-contributory) social pension design, given that exhaustion of retirement savings can leave people needing support from the state,\u201d the World Bank said in a statement yesterday. It said the focus and findings of their recent paper entitled \u2018Should Malaysia expand its social pension? Global evidence, design issues and options\u2019, is on non-\u00adcontributory social pensions, specifically the Bantuan Warga Emas (BWE) programme. The paper did not make recommendations about the minimum retirement age, it added. \u201cOur discussion and recommendation in the paper on eligibility age refers to the Bantuan Warga Emas programme. \u201cWe note that currently only about 4% of older Malaysians receive this assistance, and suggest that the government may wish to consider broadening its coverage to more B40 households. \u201cIn that context, we mention that many other countries use 65 as a benchmark age for eligibility as a means to contain the fiscal cost of such assistance,\u201d it said. On the minimum retirement age, while it is not a focus of the paper, its previous research has recommended that Malaysia gradually raise the minimum retirement age, in line with global trends and rising life expectancy (which in Malaysia now stands at over 75 years of age). This recommendation is made in the context of increasingly rapid population ageing, which presents challenges for the financial security of older Malaysians. \u201cWe do not prescribe a specific retirement age, as we note the need for societal discussion and consensus on this issue, and we argue for incremental adjustments rather than one large increase. \u201cWe appreciate the public\u2019s continued interest in this topic, and would note the importance of distinguishing between contributory retirement savings schemes (such as EPF) and non-contribu\u00adtory social assistance programmes like BWE in ongoing discussions on these issues,\u201d it said. Previously, news reports \u00adquoted the World Bank suggesting an increase in the eligibility age for social pension from 55 to between 65 and 70, saying that the current age is too low. It also said a gradual increase would ensure the sustainability of Malaysia\u2019s social protection system, while allowing retirees to enjoy larger pension benefits.

The World Bank stated that its previous analysis highlighted how access to retirement savings before retirement can lead to premature depletion of those funds. \"We note that in most countries globally, retirement savings are only accessed at retirement age. This is also important in the context of non-contributory social pension design, as exhausting retirement savings can leave people needing state support,\" the World Bank said in a statement on Sunday (Nov 2). It added that the focus of its recent paper, 'Should Malaysia expand its social pension? Global evidence, design issues and options', is on non-contributory social pensions, specifically the Bantuan Warga Emas (BWE) programme. The paper did not make recommendations about the minimum retirement age, the World Bank added. \"Our discussion and recommendation in the paper on eligibility age refers to the Bantuan Warga Emas programme. \"We note that currently only about 4% of older Malaysians receive this assistance, and suggest that the government may wish to consider broadening its coverage to more B40 households. \"In that context, we mention that many other countries use 65 as a benchmark age for eligibility to contain the fiscal cost of such assistance,\" it said. Although the minimum retirement age was not a focus of the paper, previous research from the World Bank has recommended that Malaysia gradually raise the minimum retirement age, in line with global trends and rising life expectancy, which now stands at over 75 years. This recommendation is made in response to Malaysia\u2019s rapidly ageing population, which poses challenges for the financial security of older citizens. \"We do not prescribe a specific retirement age, as we note the need for societal discussion and consensus, and we argue for incremental adjustments rather than one large increase. \"We appreciate the public\u2019s continued interest in this topic, and would note the importance of distinguishing between contributory retirement savings schemes (such as EPF) and non-contributory social assistance programmes like BWE in ongoing discussions,\" it said.

The report added that a gradual increase would help ensure the sustainability of Malaysia\u2019s social protection system while allowing retirees to enjoy larger pension benefits. It also stated that the current social pension eligibility age of 60 is below most countries\u2019 standards and no longer aligns with Malaysia\u2019s improved healthy life expectancy. An analysis by the World Bank of Malaysians\u2019 household income and spending, based on government data from 2022, showed that the risk of poverty increases with age. Hence, the World Bank said raising the eligibility age could also help better target support to elderly citizens who truly need it.

Home Economy Employee Enrolment Scheme 2025 launched to boost workforce formalisation Under the scheme, employers will not be required to remit an employee\u2019s share of contribution if it was not deducted earlier. Only a nominal penal damage of \u20b9100 will be levied, said Ministry of Labour and Employment By Dalip Singh Updated - November 01, 2025 at 09:35 PM. | New Delhi \u00d7 Share WhatsApp X Facebook LinkedIn Messenger Reddit Mail https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/economy/employee-enrolment-scheme-2025-launched-to-boost-workforce-formalisation/article70229389.ece Copy Union Labour and Employment Minister Mansukh Mandaviya The government on Saturday rolled out the Employee Enrolment Scheme 2025, providing a special window for employers to voluntarily enrol eligible employees left out from Employees\u2019 Provident Fund (EPF) coverage between July 1, 2017, and October 31, 2025, and regularise their past compliance. The scheme shall remain open for six months, from November 1, 2025 to April 30, 2026. Aimed at accelerating workforce formalisation and promoting ease of doing business, the regularisation of employees\u2019 past compliance can be done under the Employees\u2019 Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, the Ministry of Labour and Employment said in a statement. The Ministry said it will also encourage transparency, ensure universal EPF inclusion, and simplify the process of past regularisation. Under this scheme, all establishments, irrespective of existing EPF coverage status, may declare any employee engaged by them who joined between July 1, 2017 and October 31, 2025, through the EPFO portal, the Ministry statement read. For such cases, the employee\u2019s share has been waived for the declared period if not deducted earlier. The employer\u2019s obligation is limited to remit employer\u2019s share, interest (Sec 7Q), administrative charges, and the \u20b9100 penal damages. A lump-sum penalty of \u20b9100 per establishment will be deemed compliance across the three EPF schemes, the statement said. Establishments facing inquiries under Section 7A, Para 26B, or Para 8 of EPS-1995 remain eligible, with damages limited to \u20b9100 notionally. No suo-motu compliance action shall be taken by the EPFO, the Ministry assured.. The scheme was launched by Union Labour and Employment Minister Mansukh Mandaviya during the EPFO\u2019s 73 rd Foundation Day celebrations at Bharat Mandapam, New Delhi. Addressing the gathering, Mandaviya lauded EPFO\u2019s pivotal role in ensuring the social and financial well-being of India\u2019s workforce and urged the organisation to \u201cscript a new chapter in citizen-centric service delivery\u201d guided by renewed purpose and vision. \u201cEPFO is not merely a fund\u2014it represents the trust of India\u2019s workforce in social security,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we c",

The waterside city in northern Brazil is the gateway to Amazonia and the rivers and rainforests that represent all that is rich, vibrant and vital in the natural world. Host to the Cop30 climate summit, which begins next week, Bel\u00e9m is supposed to be a reminder to thousands of international delegates of what is at stake in their talks. The global climate negotiation process was initiated in Brazil with the Rio Earth Summit in the hopeful 1990s. This is to be its homecoming.

Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal stated that foreign direct and institutional investment are being enhanced. Export growth is expected to accelerate in FY26. The government also supports channeling capital from insurance and pension funds into startups. India aims to strengthen its global trade position and secure favorable trade agreements. Agencies Piyush Goyal New Delhi: India is looking at ways to bolster foreign direct investment ( FDI ) and foreign institutional investment (FII), commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said Friday. He also said India's FY26 export growth is expected to be faster than last year and supported the idea of deploying capital with insurance companies and pension funds in startups at The Economic Times Startup Awards in Bengaluru. \"The figures up to July or August that I last saw, there is a significant bump-up in the FDI flows,\" Goyal told the audience that included the biggest names of India's startup and technology world. \"Having said that, I certainly believe we need to continuously evolve our processes so we are looking at both FDI and FII flows and how we can make it easier for money to flow into the country.\" He said the world has seen the resilience, stability and confidence with which India is steering its path, and wants to do business with the country \"in an increasing manner.\" \"Our exports have grown even in the first six months of this year, and I assure each and every one of you, we're going to close FY26 with higher growth than last year. So, India is well on the path to continue to do well,\" Goyal said. India's goods and services exports in FY25 hit an all-time high of $825 billion. In the first six months of FY26, merchandise exports were $220.12 billion. The government is also working on the second leg of the startup fund of funds worth \u20b91 lakh crore, which will largely focus on deep tech innovations and startups. Live Events The Centre is leaning toward allowing funding support from pension funds and sovereign wealth funds to startups on the lines of western economies. \"I think we are all pretty much convinced that we'll have to look at supporting the startup ecosystem, or our innovation ecosystem in different ways,\" he said. \"I agree with you that one of the methods could be our large pool of capital with insurance companies and pension funds or provident fund capital being also deployed, particularly giving us a huge amount of success stories that our startups are seeing.\" Startups have become part of India's investing fabric, Times Internet chairman Satyan Gajwani had said earlier in his opening remarks. He pointed out that startups had raised \u20b91 lakh crore across 33 IPOs since 2021. In his address, Lenskart founder Peyush Bansal responded to the public scrutiny of its IPO pricing, saying he did not see criticism as a bad thing. \"It is important to listen to another's point of view but at the same time have your own,\" Bansal said. Goyal told the audience that more important than the level of US tariffs would be the edge that India would have, he said. \"Every agreement stands on comparative advantage to other nations,\" Goyal said. \"The important thing is not the amount of tariff. The important element will be -",

The decrease is due to a reduction in revenues from the Company\u2019s lower concentrate sales in Romania following the reorganisation of Vast Baita Plaia SA. 24% decrease in other administrative and overhead expenses for the year ended 30 April 2025 (US$3.162 million) compared to the year ended 30 April 2024 (US$4.163 million). A decrease in losses after taxation in the year ended 30 April 2025 (US$6.573 million) compared to the year ended 30 April 2024 (US$13.603 million as restated and disclosed in note 28). Cash balances at the end of the period were US$0.020 million compared to US$0.025 million at 30 April 2024. Operational Development BPPM milled production decreased from 86,171 metric tonnes for the year ended 30 April 2024 to 21,483 metric tonnes for the year ended 30 April 2025. Production was inevitably impacted by the Company\u2019s decision in June 2024 to enter Vast Baita Plai SA (\u201cVBPSA\u201d), the operator of BPPM, into a period of voluntary reorganisation. At Aprelevka plant production increased 58% to 449 thousand metric tonnes for the year ended 30 April 2025. In June 2024, the Company decided to enter Vast Baita Plai SA (\u201cVBPSA\u201d), the operator of BPPM, into a period of voluntary reorganisation to be effected by a Court judged process under the Insolvency Act in Romania. This was executed in response to operational pressures caused by the Unions and certain BPPM employee demands and practices which were adversely impacting mine performance. The reorganisation request was approved by the Court and a final creditor reorganisation plan is expected to be presented to the Court and finalised by the end of the calendar Q1 2026. The reorganisation does not affect the ownership or control of the mine and has been executed in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In August 2024, the Company\u2019s 100% subsidiary Vast Baita Plai SA (\u201cVBPSA\u201d) successfully extended the Head Licence held by Baita SA and under which VBPSA has the rights to mine polymetallics at BPPM for a further five years by way of Government Decision 6/2024 on 9 August 2024. In obtaining this approval, drilling results from the Company\u2019s drill campaign in 2023 were submitted. In September 2024, the Company executed agreements with an ecological project to process and market products from clean-up operations at the former Hanes Gold Mine located in the Alba region of Romania. The Company expects to begin production and marketing in 2026. As announced on 25 April 2025, the historical diamond parcel was released by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (\u201cRBZ\u201d). An amount of $0.175 million in respect of the historical costs incurred in bringing the diamond parcel to its present location and condition at the year end has been included in inventory. The Company signed a Memorandum of Understanding (the \u2018MOU\u2019) with the Government of Tajikistan and Gulf International Minerals Ltd (\u2018Gulf\u2019), (the company which appointed Vast to manage and develop the Aprelevka Gold Mines, in which Gulf holds a 49% interest) (together, the \u2018Parties\u2019). The purpose of the MOU is to provide a framework of cooperation and facili",

Both institutional and retail investors showed strong interest. The issue was subscribed 1.12 times by Friday's close. Institutional buyers led the demand, subscribing 1.42 times their reserved portion. This investor enthusiasm comes despite concerns about Lenskart's IPO valuation. 'Backlash means people care': Peyush Bansal, CEO Lenskart, on online rage over IPO valuation The initial public offering (IPO) of omnichannel eyewear retailer Lenskart was fully subscribed on the first day itself, as institutional and retail investors lapped up the portions reserved for them. The issue was subscribed 1.12 times by the close of bidding on Friday, with bids for 11.2 crore shares against the almost 9.98 crore on offer. Institutional buyers led the demand, with their basket of shares subscribed 1.42 times. This segment usually sees bidding late on the last day of the IPO. The retail portion was subscribed 1.3 times, while employees bids stood at 1.08 times their basket. High net-worth investors subscribed to only 41% of the shares reserved for them. The investor enthusiasm belies concerns over the Rs 70,000 crore valuation Lenskart is targeting with its IPO. This is equal to the company asking for Rs 235\u2013238 for every Re 1 it earns. The steep ask could potentially impact future growth (or market?) prospects. Anchor book Lenskart raised Rs 3,268.3 crore from 147 anchor investors the day before the IPO. The company allotted 8.13 crore shares at the upper end of the price band \u2014 Rs 402 per \u2014 to domestic and global investors.

This strong participation precedes its upcoming Initial Public Offering. The company is set to launch its IPO on October 31. This move highlights significant investor confidence in India's leading eyewear brand. Lenskart aims to expand its stores and invest in technology. Agencies Eyewear retailer Lenskart Solutions has raised Rs 3,268.36 crore from 147 anchor investors ahead of its much-anticipated IPO, which opens for subscription on October 31 and closes on November 4. The company allotted 8.13 crore equity shares at the upper end of the price band \u2014 Rs 402 per share (face value Rs 2 each) to a mix of marquee domestic and global institutional investors. The strong anchor participation underscores robust investor confidence in India\u2019s largest omni-channel eyewear brand, which is now making its debut on the public markets. Of the total allocation, 2.87 crore shares (35.34%) were taken up by 21 domestic mutual funds across 59 schemes, reflecting wide participation from India\u2019s top institutional investors. Among the domestic anchors, participation came from leading fund houses such as SBI Mutual Fund, HDFC Mutual Fund, ICICI Prudential Mutual Fund, Kotak Mutual Fund, Axis Mutual Fund, Aditya Birla Sun Life Mutual Fund, Mirae Asset, DSP Mutual Fund, Franklin India, HSBC Mutual Fund, WhiteOak Capital, Edelweiss , Bandhan, and Canara Robeco. Large domestic insurance companies also joined the anchor book, including SBI Life , HDFC Life , ICICI Prudential Life, Bajaj Allianz Life, Kotak Mahindra Life, Axis Max Life, Reliance Nippon Life, and Tata AIA Life Insurance.

The Government of Singapore, Monetary Authority of Singapore, and Government Pension Fund Global (Norway) were among the key sovereign participants. Live Events The anchor list also featured top-tier global asset managers such as New World Fund Inc, Fidelity, T Rowe Price, BlackRock, Capital Group, Goldman Sachs, Nomura, Amundi, JP Morgan, and Wellington Management Company LLP, underscoring global appetite for India\u2019s growing consumer-tech space.

So, yesterday at the Ministry of Defense, [\u2026] Newsroom October 30 04:53 \u2013 Hello there, if there\u2019s one thing that never ceases to amaze me, it\u2019s politics and political parties \u2014 how, from one moment to the next, they can completely change face and transform from an arena into a church, from stormy seas into calm waters, and back again. So, yesterday at the Ministry of Defense, we witnessed a united, cheerful, and above all\u2026 sweet blue government gathering (with a few bipartisan parsley sprigs tossed in), a party-government as if we were\u2026 still in the honeymoon days of 2019. They were united by Varotsos and\u2026 a thermal fa\u00e7ade, all to the tunes of Vembo. But not just any thermal fa\u00e7ade \u2014 a national one! Mitsias but Not Samaras and Rafina\u2026 The event yesterday at the Pentagon turned into a \u201cunity extravaganza,\u201d with songs by Mitsias and Angelos Papadimitriou, poems, and performances by dancers and actors in patriotic tones \u2014 all against the backdrop of the Ministry of Defense\u2019s new building. It\u2019s said that this might have been Mitsias\u2019s last live appearance. Otherwise, don\u2019t expect much political gossip amid the hubbub \u2014 though K.M. and Dendias seemed particularly at ease, smiling and chatting in small groups with several attendees. Arriving in the front row, Mitsotakis (masked, due to Covid) chatted briefly on his feet with \u201cBenny\u201d \u2014 with whom he\u2019s recently opened something resembling a political dialogue \u2014 as well as with Meimarakis, the only former ND president to show up (since Karamanlis and Samaras are still sulking, and apparently, yesterday\u2019s event wasn\u2019t quite their cup of tea). It\u2019s clear K.M. had no reason not to put a triumphant close to the \u201cDendias affair,\u201d and the minister, in turn, was eager to put an end to the uncomfortable Unknown Soldier issue. So, there was full top-level representation at the event unveiling the new face of the Ministry \u2014 sponsored by Evangelos Mytilineos \u2014 attended by the entire cabinet, MPs, and more. Everything sweet as honey and smooth as milk \u2014 just to make the blue government\u2019s foes boil a little. Doukas \u2013 Dendias They may not have seen eye to eye on the Unknown Soldier\u2019s cleaning job, but Messrs. Dendias and Doukas share the same outlook when it comes to\u2026 greenery. That\u2019s why Mr. Dendias publicly thanked the Mayor of Athens for his contribution of\u2026 saplings for the Ministry\u2019s surrounding grounds. Still, Dendias announced from the podium a new competition for redesigning the Monument of the Unknown Soldier \u2014 now that he\u2019s got the know-how for \u201creborn\u201d monuments, stairways, and fa\u00e7ades\u2026 A Corfiot in the Pentagon Corfiot-born Dendias, Corfiot actress Angela Gerekou \u2014 one can easily see how she ended up as co-host of yesterday\u2019s event at the Pentagon. Gerekou served for years (until quite recently) as president of the Greek National Tourism Organization. For those with good memories, she first ran with ND in January 2015 \u2014 when Dendias left Corfu and ran instead in the old Second Athens constituency. Of course, that inspiration didn\u2019t quite take off back then, as Gerekou wasn\u2019t elected \u2014 and in her stead, current Deputy Minister of Shipping Stefanos Gikas took the seat. A Dry Cabinet Meeting K.M.\u2019s Covid infection and the fact that the Cabinet meeting took place via teleconference meant it was shorter \u2014 and politically uneventful. The ministers were a bit stiff; no jokes, no teasing \u2014 and screens don\u2019t really favor side conversations anyway. K.M. went to his office as usual yesterday morning, had his coffee, and joined the teleconference from the Cabinet room, while his aides beside him wore masks. His schedule will continue normally for the coming days, with the necessary precautions. Hatzidakis\u2019s Proposal on Bureaucracy Besides the bill on OPEKEPE \u2014 which had to be approved as a key precondition for getting the European Commission\u2019s \u201cgreen light\u201d \u2014 Vice President Hatzidakis had another hot file for the Cabinet yesterday: tackling bureaucracy and the deep state. In this new chapter, inter-ministerial regulations will be promoted, targeting blatant cases of citizens\u2019 and businesses\u2019 torment at the hands of the state. In his address, Hatzidakis cited as an example of bureaucratic a",

Read part one here . Globalisation has always had its critics \u2013 but until recently , they have come mainly from the left rather than the right. In the wake of the second world war, as the world economy grew rapidly under US dominance, many on the left argued that the gains of globalisation were unequally distributed, increasing inequality in rich countries while forcing poorer countries to implement free-market policies such as opening up their financial markets, privatising their state industries and rejecting expansionary fiscal policies in favour of debt repayment \u2013 all of which mainly benefited US corporations and banks. This was not a new concern. Back in 1841, German economist Friedrich List had argued that free trade was designed to keep Britain\u2019s global dominance from being challenged, suggesting: When anyone has obtained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he climbs up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. By the 1990s, critics of the US vision of a global world order such as the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argued that globalisation in its current form benefited the US at the expense of developing countries and workers \u2013 while author and activist Naomi Klein focused on the negative environmental and cultural consequences of the global expansion of multinational companies. Mass left-led demonstrations broke out, disrupting global economic meetings including, most famously, the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999. During this \u201cbattle of Seattle\u201d , violent exchanges between protesters and police prevented the launch of a new world trade round that had been backed by then US president, Bill Clinton. For a while, the mass mobilisation of a coalition of trade unionists, environmentalists and anti-capitalist protesters seemed set to challenge the path towards further globalisation \u2013 with anti-capitalism \u201cOccupy\u201d protests spreading around the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. A documentary about the 1999 \u2018batte of Seattle\u2019, directed by Jill Friedberg and Rick Rowley. In the US, a further critique of globalisation centred on its domestic consequences for American workers \u2013 namely, job losses and lower pay \u2013 and led to calls for greater protectionism. Although initially led by trade unions and some Democratic politicians, this critique gradually gained purchase in radical right circles who opposed giving any role to international organisations like the WTO, on the grounds that they impinged on American sovereignty. According to this view, only by stopping foreign competition whose low wages undercut American workers could prosperity be restored. Immigration was another target. Under Donald Trump\u2019s second term as US president, these criticisms have been transformed into radical, deeply disruptive economic and social policies \u2013 with tariffs and protectionism at their heart. In so doing, Trump \u2013 despite all his grandstanding on the world stage \u2013 has confirmed what has long been clear to close observers of US politics and business: that the American century of global dominance, with the dollar as unrivalled no.1 currency , is drawing rapidly to a close. Even before Trump first took office in 2017, the US had begun to withdraw from its ",

Story continues below this ad What\u2019s the ongoing story: With Bihar going to polls soon, Chhath has attracted a lot of political attention this year, with leaders across party lines offering greetings. While Chhath has been celebrated in Bihar, parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Nepal for centuries, over the past decade or so, it has become a lot more visible across the country. Key Points to Ponder: \u2014 Explore the role of Chhath Puja in promoting social equality, community participation, and inclusivity \u2014 How has migration and diaspora helped in the spread and popularity of Chhath puja? \u2014 How do regional celebrations across India reflect the diversity and unity of Indian culture? Story continues below this ad \u2014 Is Chhath Puja recognised in UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage? \u2014 How politics get intertwined with the religious aspect of a region? \u2014 Know about the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) elements from India Key Takeaways: \u2014 Chhath Puja is a four-day elaborate celebration in honour of the Sun. It involves a long fast without water, and making offerings to Usha and Pratyusha, the light of the rising and the setting Sun, while standing in a water body. The prominent rituals begin from the sixth day ( shashthi ) of the Kartik shukla paksha , which means the waxing-moon fortnight of the month of Kartik. Story continues below this ad \u2014 Some believe that it is a carryover from the time that man worshipped nature. The Rig Veda mentions elaborate rituals to worship the sun. Others trace its origins in the great epics, the Ramayana and the Mahabharata. \u2014 After Lord Ram and Goddess Sita returned victorious to Ayodhya from Lanka, they are said to have observed a fast and conducted a yagna for the Sun god. \u2014 In the Mahabharata, when the Pandavas were in exile, some sages visited them. Draupadi, realising she had nothing to offer them, went to sage Dhaumya for help. He advised her to observe a fast and pray to the Sun, and eventually, all her prayers were answered. In the same epic, Karna also organised an elaborate ceremony in honour of Surya (the Sun), his father. \u2014 Today, Chhath is a festival that epitomises religiosity in Bihar, and countless devotees join their hands as the Sun\u2019s rays spread over them. Story continues below this ad \u2014 Chhathi maiya or Mother Chhathi, Sun\u2019s sister, is considered an exacting but generous deity. While the rules governing the four-day festival are exceedingly strict, immense spiritual gains are said to accrue to whoever observes them all successfully. \u2014 The first day of the festival is called naha kha, where those observing it take a meal ( khana ) only after a ceremonial bath in a river or a pond ( nahana ). Water brought back from the waterbody is used to make a chulha or a stove, and meals for those observing the fast are prepared on this for the rest of the festival. The meal partaken after the bath consists of a pumpkin sabzi. \u2014 The second day is called kharna, on which the one observing the fast takes only one meal in the evening, of roti and kheer (rice pudding). On the third day, devotees go to the banks of a water bo",

A proposal to use frozen Russian assets for a loan faces hurdles, with Belgium expressing concerns. Alternative options, like joint debt or direct grants, present financial challenges for member states. Negotiations are ongoing to secure vital funds for Ukraine's defense and economy. NYT News Service FILE -- A memorial to fallen soldiers in Odesa, Ukraine, Nov. 9, 2025. The European Union wants to finance Ukraine's war efforts using a loan based on Russia's frozen assets in Belgium. If that falls through, there's no easy alternative. (Mauricio Lima/The New York Times) BRUSSELS: European Union officials have spent months focused on a plan to use frozen Russian assets to make a loan to Ukraine that could help Ukraine fight the next phase of the war. It is increasingly clear that the bloc has nothing but bad alternatives should that fail. The loan plan, through which the European Union would use Russia's central bank assets in Belgium to funnel 140 billion euros (about $160 billion) to Ukraine, was expected to move forward at the bloc's political meeting last month. Instead, in a last-minute surprise, Belgium blocked it. Belgian officials say they are worried the nation could be on the hook should Russia file a lawsuit or demand its money back. To mitigate that risk, they are asking that other European nations firmly commit to taking on some of the burden through guarantees, a suggestion that has met with pushback from Slovakia. They have also been pressing the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, to consider other options for getting money to Ukraine. The commission set out those alternatives in a letter sent to national capitals Monday and seen by The New York Times. One option would be for the European Union to issue joint debt to raise the money Ukraine needs. Another would be for individual member states to give Ukraine direct grants. But both have problems. Joint borrowing would be expensive, entailing interest costs, and direct grants would strain the budgets of already-indebted nations. Live Events Given that, policymakers, diplomats and outside experts in Brussels often voice confidence that the frozen asset loan plan will come together -- not because it is without complications, but because the backups are so unattractive at a moment when so much is at stake. \"What is clear is that Plan B is less good than Plan A,\" said Nicolas V\u00e9ron, who cofounded the economic research organization Bruegel in Brussels and who is also at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington. \"Is not giving money to Ukraine an option? The answer is no.\" Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the commission, said last week that while the other two options exist, the loan using the frozen assets \"is the most effective way to sustain Ukraine's defense and its economy.\" The frozen asset loan plan offers advantages. The bloc would be able to make Ukraine a zero-interest loan that would need to be paid back only if Russia paid reparations. It would also allow for a big, headline-grabbing cash infusion that would demonstrate to the Kremlin that Ukraine has the funding to get through the war. Not only would the alternatives prove more financially stressful, but they would most likely involve only smalle",

Paris wants the G7 nations to provide financial guarantees for the unprecedented move, according to Barrot. The EU Commission is seeking to issue a \u20ac140 billion ($160 billion) loan secured against immobilized Russian sovereign assets held at the Euroclear clearing house in Belgium. Under the scheme, Ukraine would only pay it back if it receives reparations from Russia once the conflict is over \u2013 an outcome widely viewed as unlikely. The plan has faced opposition from Belgium, which holds the bulk of Russian assets at the Euroclear clearing house. The nation has demanded all EU members share the financial and legal risks of the move. According to Barrot, France has a set of demands linked to the proposed loan as well. Russian assets used as a collateral for the loan should not be \u201cconfiscated\u201d to avoid legal issues, the minister said. G7 nations should provide guarantees for the loan alongside the EU nations \u201cso that they carry the financial risk associated with this loan together with us,\u201d he maintained, adding that \u201cwe do not have absolute certainty that it will be repaid.\u201d Read more NATO member refuses to back EU attack on Russian assets Paris also demanded the loan be spent \u201con the military\u201d in a way that \u201callows us to develop our\u2026 defense industry.\u201d The EU has already sought to secure guarantees for the loan from various nations. Last week, Norway refused to use its \u20ac1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) sovereign wealth fund as a financial backstop for the scheme. Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico also said earlier this month that his nation would not support the plan. EU leaders failed to reach an agreement on the confiscation during a summit in October, effectively postponing a final decision until a European Council meeting in December. Russia has warned that seizing its frozen assets and using them to finance Ukraine would amount to theft, and that there is \u201cno legal way\u201d for Brussels to do so.

Kyle Torpey Published November 16, 2025 Reading time 3 minutes The front gate of Harvard \u00a9 Marcio Jose Bastos Silva via Shutterstock Read Later Read Later Comments (15) According to a new SEC filing , the Harvard University endowment\u2019s largest publicly-traded investment is now in the iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT), which is a spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) operated by Blackrock. The filing indicates the endowment increased its holdings of IBIT from 1,906,000 shares to 6,813,612 shares since its previous such report. At current prices, the value of those IBIT holdings sits at around $364 million. This is already down rather heavily from the roughly $443 million valuation included in the filing, as bitcoin\u2019s price has recently been struggling and now appears stuck under the $100,000 mark. As pointed out by MacroScope on X, another notable, and perhaps related, aspect of this recent filing is the 99% increase in gold ETF SPDR Gold Shares as well. Bitcoin is now Harvard\u2019s largest reportable public investment. Larger than Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and others. See link below for the list. Of course Harvard\u2019s total endowment is much larger and includes private investments that aren\u2019t publicly reported. But yesterday\u2019s BTC\u2026 https://t.co/OsV0XFAb6N \u2014 MacroScope (@MacroScope17) November 15, 2025 In addition to their notable bitcoin and gold holdings, the Harvard University endowment also reported large investments in tech giants like Microsoft, Nvidia, and Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company). Again, it should be noted that this SEC filing only covers the endowment\u2019s holdings in the public markets. According to a recent report by Reuters , the total size of the Harvard University endowment sits at roughly $57 billion, with only 14% of that being held in public equities. That valuation would indicate the endowment\u2019s holdings in IBIT represent less than 1% of its overall portfolio. However, it\u2019s definitely possible that the endowment also has bitcoin exposure in some of its privately-held investments. According to Forbes , Harvard has the largest endowment among all universities. Growing Trust in Bitcoin as a Store of Value Of course, Harvard is not going out on a limb on their own in terms of their bitcoin holdings. In terms of university endowments with bitcoin exposure, there have been reports pointing to fellow Ivy leaguers Brown and Yale, in addition to many others . These endowment funds tend to be focused on long-term , fundamental value rather than short-term trades based around temporary hype.

Just this past week, the Czech National Bank announced its first bitcoin purchase for the purpose of evaluating the potential addition of the crypto asset to their international reserves, despite objections from European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde. Of course, the establishment of a strategic bitcoin reserve was also a campaign promise made by now President Donald Trump, but such a reserve has yet to materialize . While those more aligned with Bitcoin\u2019s original cypherpunk ethos are becoming increasingly worried about the extremely prevalent use of third-party bitcoin custodians by the vast majority of these large institutions, this type of adoption does at least still enable the intended removal of trust in terms of the crypto asset\u2019s underlying, unwavering monetary policy. However, there still seems to be plenty of work to be done when it comes to other cypherpunk values, such as the decentralization of payments and financial privacy, as illustrated by the crypto industry\u2019s heavy embrace of stablecoins .

Nightly, for months now, Ukraine\u2019s cities have been pounded by relentless aerial attacks. In addition to its grinding and attritional ground offensives in the east and south of the country, since early summer, the Russian military has greatly expanded its air offensive against centres of population, looking to collapse morale and undermine the Ukrainian people\u2019s will to fight on. And as winter approaches, so those aerial bombardments have targeted Ukraine\u2019s power infrastructure. Repeatedly in recent weeks, whole cities have been plunged into cold darkness as power plants, transmission lines and regional and local substations are damaged or destroyed. Rolling power outages are now common, reportedly lasting up to 14 hours in some cases. So the latest political scandal to hit the government of Volodymyr Zelensky could hardly have come at a worse time for his country. And to make matters worse, it revolves around Ukraine\u2019s energy industry. Ukraine\u2019s anti-corruption agencies this week released the findings of Operation Midas, an 18-month probe into Energoatom, the state-owned operator of all of Ukraine\u2019s nuclear power plants, investigating allegations of bribes and kickbacks said to amount to US$100 million (\u00a376 million). Raids were carried out around the country and seven people have been arrested. What makes this so dangerous for Zelensky is that one of the people named in the probe is a former business partner of his. Businessman Timur Mindich was the co-owner, with Zelensky, of Kvartal 95 Studio \u2013 the platform on which the Ukrainian president made his name as a comedian before he entered politics (ironically, under the circumstances, as an anti-corruption candidate). Mindich is reported to have left the country, but he is said to have connections to several senior government ministers. The scandal risks tainting the already embattled Zelensky government by association. What\u2019s worse, as Stefan Wolff and Tetyana Malyarenko explain , is that only a few months before this scandal exploded, Zelensky tried to bring Ukraine\u2019s independent anti-corruption agencies under the direct control of his government. He backed down in the face of huge demonstrations, but this latest corruption scandal is likely to weaken him further. He has already lost his justice minister, German Galushchenko, and energy minister, Svitlana Hrynchuk. And, as Wolff and Malyarenko point out, the last thing Zelensky needs while his European allies debate how to raise desperately needed funds to keep fighting is a whiff of corruption surrounding his administration. Read more: Ukraine: energy corruption scandal threatens to derail Zelensky's government and undermine its war effort Having spent the day debating how to raise the huge amounts of money Ukraine will need in 2026, it appears that the EU is closing in on a preferred option. The European Commission considered two main options. One plan is for either the EU to borrow \u20ac140 billion (\u00a3124 billion) using its long-term budget as collateral. Another is to use the frozen Russian assets as collateral for a loan to Ukraine, to be repaid after the war if Russia pays reparations to Kyiv. An idea floated by Norwegian economists to use Norway\u2019s \u20ac1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund to guarantee the loan was quickly scotched by the country\u2019s finance minister, former Nato secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg, who said that while Norway was happy to contribute, it could not be responsible for the entire amount. The next move will be to assuage the fears of Belgium, which is where the assets are held by securities depository Euroclear, that a successful legal challenge by Russia could leave it liable for repayment. The Kremlin has already made noises to this effect. Veronika Hinman, the deputy di",

A look at the latest round of Trump\u2019s especially jaw-dropping recent statements and where they stand: 50-year mortgages WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it. BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site an image of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt under the heading \u201c30-Year Mortgage\u201d alongside one of himself under a \u201c50-Year Mortgage\u201d title. Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, posted that longer mortgages would be \u201ca complete game changer,\u201d while the White House says it could ease housing affordability pressures . Extending loan terms by two decades would lower monthly payments, but it\u2019d also leave mortgage-holders waiting significantly longer to build home equity.

[Ezra Acayan/Getty Image] America\u2019s renewed scepticism, and even hostility under Donald Trump\u2019s second administration, does not for one moment alter the fact that climate change is real. Neither does it negate the reality that the Global South \u2014 including the almost 700 million-strong Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), virtually all of which are tropical countries \u2014 is on the front line of the climate crisis. Typhoons Tino and Uwan, which recently struck our region, especially the Philippines, are the latest proof of this and a reminder of the urgent need for climate justice. What the Global South needs from summits like COP30 has been stated time and time again. It really boils down to four things. The developed world needs to listen On the one hand, developed countries need to listen to developing and less developed countries on how climate change should be addressed. A rigid approach to the various facets of climate action, including technology, energy transition and biodiversity conservation, will ultimately frustrate the sincere, proactive measures that many Global South countries, including Malaysia and several of its ASEAN partners, are taking towards these goals. More flexibility on the part of the Global North would go a long way towards ensuring that the war against climate change is won. This is not an attempt to water down or deflect anything. The right to live in a sustainable environment is arguably a fundamental human right. Israel\u2019s devastating war in Gaza has also resulted in widespread ecocide that Western nations have remained strangely silent on, but whose ramifications \u2014 not only for the Middle East but for the wider world \u2014 will last for decades. Advertisement There should therefore be no doubt that sustainability and human rights go together. Supporting the former, especially in ASEAN and the Global South, is a means of upholding the latter. Developed countries should bring their chequebooks At the risk of putting things crudely, money talks. The various climate finance commitments \u2014 especially those for vulnerable nations \u2014 must not only be fulfilled, but also increased. Projections from the United Nations Global Policy Model estimate that developing countries will need around $1.1 trillion in climate finance by 2025 and some $1.8 trillion by 2030. The chair of the COP30 UN Climate Change Conference, Brazil, has rightly said that it hopes the meeting in Belem will be remembered as \u201cthe COP of Adaptation Implementation\u201d. This is astute because, while I do not share the view that it is too late to act, it should be painfully clear that climate action can no longer be about setting lofty goals. Rather, the time has come to deliver. The Global South can lead on climate change Admittedly, the absence of the United States \u2014 as the world\u2019s superpower and largest economy \u2014 looms over the COP and any international efforts to protect the environment. But the absence of the US is not a reason to retreat from climate action, or any other international cause; rather, it is an opportunity to reaffirm and strengthen multilateral cooperation. Although it would be nice to have the US involved, the world can act without America. As has been widely reported, China\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions have either flatlined or fallen over the past 18 months. Moreover, the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF), proposed by Brazil\u2019s President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, is an important part of the solution. With the World Bank as its trustee and interim host, the TFFF seeks to support lasting conservation strategies and protect crucial tropical ecosystems through global, public and private partnerships. With a medium-term goal of achieving a $125bn fund, the TFFF Launch Declaration has been endorsed by 53 countries and 19 sovereign wealth funds. Among them are 34 tropical",

There are three mechanisms presently under consideration. One is using Russia\u2019s frozen assets to back a loan of \u20ac140 billion (\u00a3124 billion). Another is borrowing the money at interest, although this is not popular. The third idea, which was proposed by Norwegian economists, is that Norway could use its \u20ac1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund \u2013 the biggest in the world \u2013 to guarantee the loan. It appears that after a day of discussion, finance ministers backed a proposal from the European Commission to use Russian assets. The situation on the front has been largely static for months, although Russian forces have been making small gains in some key areas. The battles for the strategically important cities of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine and Huliaipole in the southern region of Zaporizhzhia are a good indication of the progress of the war in general . It\u2019s hard, amid the flood of disinformation, to accurately monitor from a distance the exact status of these two important battles. Each day brings fresh reports of multiple attacks and advances by Russian troops. There have also been reports that Russian units have captured Pokrovsk. This would be a serious blow for Ukraine, as it\u2019s an important supply hub, with several roads and rail lines converging there. But the US-based military think-tank the Institute for the Study of War (ISW), which uses geolocated footage on which to base its assessments, has determined that Russia is not yet in full control of Pokrovsk , having to date seized 46% of the city. ISW analysts say Russian military bloggers are \u201cmounting a concerted informational campaign prematurely calling the fall of Pokrovsk, likely to influence the information space\u201d. The battle for Pokrovsk has raged for nearly 18 months now, without resolution \u2013 but with huge casualties on both sides. Similarly, while the situation in Huliaipole is deteriorating for the Ukrainian defenders, \u201cRussian forces will probably spend considerable time setting conditions for efforts to seize the settlement\u201d, the ISW says. It\u2019s important to realise that Russian troops initially entered Huliaipole on March 5 2022 within weeks of its initial invasion the previous month, but were quickly pushed back by Ukrainian troops. Fighting has continued in the region ever since. In other words while both sides have made some tactical gains, neither holds the strategic upper hand. One thing is clear: despite the claims and counter-claims, both sides have suffered significant casualties . In June 2025, the UK Ministry of Defence estimated more than one million Russian troops have been killed or injured since the invasion in February 2022. But Russia still retains considerable reserves of troops to call on , and has not yet had to resort to full mobilisation. Meanwhile Russia\u2019s economy is holding up , despite western sanctions. The effect of the recent imposition of oil sanctions by the US has yet to be seen. At the same time, Russia\u2019s continuing and thriving diplomatic, economic and military relationships with its \u201cenabler ally\u201d China, as well as others on the a",

Speaking to the broadcaster NRK on Wednesday, Stoltenberg, a two term head of NATO, dismissed suggestions that Oslo could leverage part of its \u20ac1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) fund to move Brussels\u2019 proposed \u201creparation loan\u201d for Kiev out of its present quagmire. The idea had reportedly been floated in Norwegian media and backed by some local politicians ahead of a visit by Stoltenberg to Brussels on Wednesday. \u201cThere have been suggestions that Norway should guarantee the entire amount,\u201d he said. \u201cThat is not the case. Whether we can contribute will depend on what the EU proposes.\u201d The European Commission is seeking to issue a \u20ac140 billion ($160 billion) loan secured against immobilized Russian sovereign assets held at the Euroclear clearing house in Belgium. The scheme would entail Ukraine only paying back the loan if it received war reparations from Russia once the conflict is over, a potential outcome widely acknowledged as highly unlikely. Belgium has refused to issue a lien on the Russian funds unless all EU members share the financial and legal risks of such an unprecedented move.

According to Ukraine's National Anti-Corruption Bureau (NABU), Mindich, reportedly known as \u201cZelensky's wallet,\u201d was the ringleader of a scheme through which at least $100 million in kickbacks was extorted from contractors of state nuclear operator Energoatom.

Off On Stream on 50-year mortgages? NFL kickoff rules? Here's where some of Trump's latest jaw-dropping musings stand President Donald Trump often offers ideas that once seem outlandish, then repeating them until they gain traction and begin sounding more mainstream By WILL WEISSERT Associated Press November 13, 2025, 12:01 AM 1:23 FILE - President Donald Trump speaks with reporters in the Cabinet Room of the White House, Nov. 7, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci, File) The Associated Press WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump loves offering outlandish ideas and then repeating them until they start to become mainstream \u2014 even if they don't always come to fruition. Some notions that once felt far-fetched are now the norm, like insisting his government has a Department of War , imposing global tariffs at rates unseen since the Gilded Age and pardoning members of the mob that overran the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. But other musings force him to find ways to save face without keeping his word. And many disappear as simply unworkable. A look at the latest round of Trump\u2019s especially jaw-dropping recent statements and where they stand: WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it. BACKSTORY: Trump posted on his social media site an image of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt under the heading \u201c30-Year Mortgage\" alongside one of himself under a \u201c50-Year Mortgage\" title. Bill Pulte, director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, posted that longer mortgages would be \u201ca complete game changer,\u201d while the White House says it could ease housing affordability pressures . Extending loan terms by two decades would lower monthly payments, but it'd also leave mortgage-holders waiting significantly longer to build home equity. After the idea was panned by economists and even some in the GOP, Trump tried to downplay his own suggestion. \u201cAll it means is you pay less per month,\" he told Fox News\u2019 \u201cThe Ingraham Angle.\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt nonetheless said Wednesday that Trump's economic advisers are \u201cseriously looking into\u201d proposals to make it happen. WHERE IT STANDS: Still talking about it. BACKSTORY: Trump suggested online that the tariffs he's imposed could result in \u201ca dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high income people!).\" Experts scoff at the idea , noting that American consumers already are stuck paying high import levies passed onto them by exporters. Even Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has since said the idea may not mean Americans get a check . The administration has collected more than $225 billion in tariff revenue , short of what it would cost to cover so many $2,000 checks, no matter how it defines \u201chigh income people.\u201d Still, Leavitt said the White House \u201cis committed to making\" revenue checks a reality. WHERE IT STANDS: In limbo. BACKSTORY: Trump floated the idea of sending $10,000 bonus checks to air traffic controllers who stayed on the job without pay during the government shutdown . But when asked how he'd pay for it on \u201cThe Ingraham Angle,\u201d the president replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know\" before adding, \u201cI always get the money from someplace, regardless. It doesn\u2019t matter.\" WHERE IT STANDS: Faded away. BACKSTORY: Trump issued a September statement directing \u201cthe enforcement of death penalty laws in the District of Columbia.\" That followed earlier suggestions that those convicted of murder in Washington should be put to death. But the D.C. City Council repealed capital punishment starting in 1981. In a Congress-mandated referendum 11 years later, city voters rejected reinstating the death penalty. The U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and Justice Department report to Trump, but most crimes committed in Washington, even murder, don't qualify as federal offenses. WHERE IT STANDS: Political off-ramp found. Popular Reads Dad, 7-year-old daughter dead after wave pulls them into the ocean Nov 17, 7:03 PM Trump, Marjorie Taylor Greene escalate feud over Epstein probe Nov 16, 6:56 PM Government shutdown updates: Trump signs government funding bill Nov 12, 11:17 PM BACKSTORY: Trump signed a February executive order directing his administration to develop a plan to create a government-owned investment fund. Sovereign wealth funds are typically state-run investment pools derived from surpluses generated by oil wealth in places like Saudi Arabia and Norway. The U.S. has no surplus funds, though, and instead runs up towering budget deficits that have grown since Trump took office . As a workaround, the government has been directing funding to acquire stakes in firms like U.S. Steel , Intel and mineral and rare earth companies \u2014 moves the Trump administration says have national security implications \u2014",

Listen AI generated Text-to-speech Copy Link Copied Share via email Share on X Share on WhatsApp Share on LinkedIn Free article usually reserved for subscribers With the frozen assets lying in a Brussels-based financial depository called Euroclear, the Belgians fear they are exposed to the financial and legal risks of using Russian assets. | Thierry Monasse/Getty Images November 11, 2025 4:11 am CET By Bjarke Smith-Meyer , Seb Starcevic and Camille Gijs The European effort to tap frozen Russian assets to keep Ukraine afloat is stalling over Belgian objections, but Slovakia\u2019s leader is reminding the EU that he\u2019s also in line to block the plan. Belgium\u2019s demands for financial guarantees from EU capitals against the loan have become the focal point of the initiative, which would leverage frozen Russian state assets on Belgian soil. Top brass within the European Commission fell short of convincing the Belgian premiership to get on board with the plan on Friday, according to two officials briefed on the talks. Then Slovakia\u2019s prime minister, Robert Fico, chimed in, further complicating the bloc\u2019s drive to fill Kyiv\u2019s war chest before it runs bare in the spring. Advertisement Advertisement \u201cSlovakia won\u2019t take part in any legal or financial schemes to seize frozen assets if those funds would be spent on military costs in Ukraine,\u201d Fico told the Slovakian public broadcaster , STVR, on Sunday. Fico\u2019s comments signal the legal challenge the Commission faces to counteract the veto threat that Kremlin-friendly countries in the EU have over Russian sanctions \u2014 also a key demand from the Belgians. The Commission is working on a legal loophole to keep the Russian assets on ice until Moscow ends the war and pays war reparations to Ukraine. Without the loophole, Slovakia or Hungary could torpedo the entire initiative when the EU needs to reauthorize its Russian sanctions every six months , sending any sanctions cash back to Moscow. \u201cSlovakia won\u2019t take part in any legal or financial schemes to seize frozen assets if those funds would be spent on military costs in Ukraine,\u201d Fico told the Slovakian public broadcaster, STVR, on Sunday. | Robert Nemeti/Anadolu via Getty Images EU finance ministers will take up the debate again when they meet for this month\u2019s Ecofin gathering in Brussels, with hopes that the Commission will formally provide a list of alternative financing options for Ukraine if the EU can\u2019t agree to use sanctioned Kremlin cash. The options list is designed to focus minds and remind EU capitals that they\u2019ll to dig into their own coffers to back Ukraine, if the reparations loan fails to get off the ground \u2014 an unappealing prospect for countries whose economies are still reeling from a bruising pandemic. The same goes for Slovakia, whose debt pile hit 88.2 percent of its economic output in the summer. Spare change Meanwhile, the Commission is looking for other channels to help buttress Ukraine\u2019s finances so that it can keep up the fight against Russian forces.

[Photo by Per Ole Hagen/Redferns] Former NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg\u2019s new memoir lays bare how Washington choreographed almost every step the Western military alliance has taken over the past decade \u2013 from headline politics like defence-spending targets to the nerdiest technical adjustments of the organisation\u2019s machinery. In On My Watch , Stoltenberg revisits the events that defined global security over the past fifteen years. Packed with inside details, it charts his decade as NATO secretary-general, from 2014 until autumn 2024 \u2013 a period spanning Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, the alliance\u2019s withdrawal from Afghanistan, Moscow\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and NATO\u2019s enlargement to include Finland and Sweden. Across those years, and the wildly different American presidencies of Barack Obama, Donald Trump, and Joe Biden, the memoir consistently depicts the United States as both conductor and metronome of the Alliance. The Leader Stoltenberg recalls the 2016 Warsaw Summit when Obama, the US president, steered messaging way from confrontation with Russian leader Vladimir Putin and towards shared democratic values \u2013 a theme that still echoes through NATO\u2019s corridors today. Anyone used to roaming the corridors of the world\u2019s largest military alliance knows Washington sets the beat while the rest follow. Close to no one would admit that on the record \u2013 diplomats and civil servants work very hard to avoid sharing details that would undermine that which is most precious to them, the \u201cunity\u201d of the alliance. Discretion is sacred. Unity is prized. Contrary to the EU\u2019s dynamic, where member countries clash publicly as part of the political process, NATO allies pride themselves on singing from the same hymn sheet. Stoltenberg\u2019s book breaks the silence. It lifts the veil on how NATO operates and maintains cohesion even amid discord. During his first White House term, Trump shaped NATO\u2019s story around his own perceived victories. At the chaotic 2018 Brussels Summit, Trump publicly bashed Angela Merkel\u2019s Germany for failing to meet the then-mandated 2% of GDP on defence. A handwritten note reproduced in the book shows Trump instructing Stoltenberg to say: \u201c Because of Pres. Trump we have raised an additional 33 billion dollars.\u201d Without fail, Stoltenberg attributed this lift in defence spending to Trump \u2013 even though the former alliance chief says himself in the book that correlation cannot be proven. The handwritten note to Stoltenberg pictured in the book on the summit\u2019s stationery also gives him the instruction to say: \u201cWe have committed to Pres Trump to raise this number substantially this year.\u201d Others pushed back. Danish Prime Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen, he recalls, rebuked Trump behind closed doors, telling him Denmark lost proportionally more troops in Afghanistan than the US. \u201cHe refused to tell the families of the dead soldiers their sacrifice was worthless because Denmark did not meet the 2% target\u201d, Stoltenberg writes. Behind Stoltenberg\u2019s usually impassive public image, the memoir reveals flashes of emotion and self-doubt, showing both Europe\u2019s dependence on US leadership and the depth of NATO\u2019s instinct to appear united. Stoltenberg still abides by that tradition. During the messy withdrawal of Afghanistan in August 2021 under the Biden administration, lips stayed as tight as possible. Stoltenberg describes the withdrawal as \u201cchaotic\u201d, but does not blame the US, instead painting the picture of a helpless Europe, unable to save its local staff and forced to leave suddenly, after decades of involvement. When mentioning his proposal to set up long-term financial support to Ukraine at the Washington Summit, he states the US refused to back the idea, without saying more. The Deal-maker US influence was most striking in not only sinking deals, but also in making them happen. The Biden administration, initially reluctant to negotiate Sweden and Finland\u2019s NATO accession, was ultimately drawn in \u2013 even offering Turkey the prospect of F-16 fighter jets to secure its approval. But even on the technical level, the US would get involved. France had long resisted any chan",

Digital Journal WORLD TECH & SCIENCE SOCIAL MEDIA BUSINESS ENTERTAINMENT LIFE SPORTS Business Will \u2018war profiteer\u2019 Norway come to Ukraine\u2019s financial rescue? By AFP Published November 7, 2025 Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is keen for further financial support from European allies - Copyright AFP Angelos TZORTZINIS Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is keen for further financial support from European allies - Copyright AFP Angelos TZORTZINIS Pierre-Henry DESHAYES Norway has grown vastly richer after overtaking Russia as Europe\u2019s main gas supplier following the invasion of Ukraine, sparking calls in Oslo for the Scandinavian nation to use its colossal sovereign wealth fund to help Kyiv. With some in Norway saying their country\u2019s windfall makes it a \u201cwar profiteer\u201d, several Norwegian political parties, including allies of the Labour government, are pushing for Oslo to help lift a main obstacle blocking Europe from using frozen Russian assets to help Ukraine financially. Western nations have frozen billions in Russian assets over Moscow\u2019s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, including approximately 210 billion euros ($243 billion) held in Europe. Ukraine\u2019s European allies have been using interest from those funds to support Kyiv, but are keen to go further by tapping the funds themselves \u2014 a proposal some warn carries huge risks, including spooking other foreign nations into pulling their money from the European Union. That is where Norway comes in. \u201cIt is absolutely essential for Europe\u2019s security that Russia does not win its illegal war of aggression,\u201d the head of Norway\u2019s small opposition Liberal Party, Guri Melby, told AFP. \u201cNorway has the financial means to guarantee a loan that would enable Ukraine to better defend itself against Russia, and I think we should do it,\u201d she said. \u2013 Backing for mega-loan \u2013 The plan goes like this. At a time when many EU member states have strained public finances, the European Commission plans to use part of the frozen Russian assets to give Ukraine a 140-billion-euro loan, interest free, to finance its budgetary and military support over the next two years. But Belgium, home to the international deposit organisation Euroclear, which holds the bulk of the frozen assets, has demanded strict guarantees from other EU countries in order to share the risks in the event, for example, that Russia were to regain possession of its assets. Some heavily indebted countries, such as France, would have a hard time agreeing to such a demand. Arguing that Norway, Western Europe\u2019s biggest oil and gas producer, made an extra 109 billion euros from soaring gas prices after Russia\u2019s invasion, two Norwegian economists have suggested their country should step up even though it is not an EU member. \u201cBy hoarding these profits, Norway\u2019s government turned the country into a war profiteer,\u201d the duo, Havard Halland and Knut Anton Mork, wrote in an op-ed last month. Thanks to its AAA credit rating \u2014 the highest awarded by rating agencies \u2014 and its sovereign wealth fund, the world\u2019s biggest, valued at around $2.1 trillion, Norway \u201ccould singlehandedly take on the contingent liability associated with fresh Ukrainian debt, and without a dent to its credit rating\u201d, they said. The idea resonated with some European political leaders. \u201cThat would be great,\u201d said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen during an EU summit in Copenhagen last month. Norway\u2019s government, which has already earmarked civil and military aid of more than 275 billion kroner ($27.4 billion) to Kyiv over the 2023-2030 period, is proceeding cautiously. \u201cWe are closely monitoring the situation and continuing our dialogue with the European Union,\u201d said finance ministry state secretary Ellen Reitan. \u2013 \u2018Moral obligation\u2019 \u2013 According to AFP\u2019s sources, Norway is in talks with Brussels but has no current plans to provide a single-handed safety net to Kyiv. Norway\u2019s Greens Party is considering making the issue one of its demands in upcoming budget negotiations with the government, which needs the Greens\u2019 support, among others, to pass its 2026 budget bill. \u201cNorway is the only country in Europe that has so much money set aside and can allocate such a sum without needing to take on debt or raise taxes,\u201d Greens leader Arild Hermstad told AFP. \u201cAnd besides, we have made so much money as a result of this war that it is simply a moral obligation.\u201d In this article: Conflict , Diplomacy , Economy , Eu , Norway , Russia , Ukraine News Written By AFP With 2,400 staff representing 100 different nationalities, AFP covers the world as a leading global news agency.

Musk will have to meet a series of milestones over the next decade to earn it. Some analysts say Musk could still make billions of dollars if he manages to meet some goals. [File: Patrick Pleul/Pool via Reuters] By Sarah Shamim and News Agencies Published On 7 Nov 2025 7 Nov 2025 Click here to share on social media share2 Share facebook twitter whatsapp copylink Save Tesla CEO Elon Musk could receive the largest corporate pay package in history worth as much as $878bn if he meets certain performance targets. Here is what this means, and how Musk could become history\u2019s first trillionaire. What has been announced? Musk won a Tesla shareholder vote on Thursday, with more than 75 percent in favour, during the company\u2019s annual general meeting at the electric carmaker\u2019s factory in Austin, Texas. Under this plan, Musk could be given stock worth $1 trillion over the next decade if he hits certain performance targets. However, he would be required to repay some of this to the company \u2013 bringing it down to $878bn. Musk is already the richest man in the world, worth about $473bn, according to Bloomberg. This payout would take him over the $1-trillion line if he maintains this level of wealth. Tesla shares jumped by 2 percent in pre-market trading on Friday, but have soared by more than 62 percent in the past six months. Tesla CEO Elon Musk gets into a Tesla car as he leaves a hotel in Beijing, China, on May 31, 2023 [Tingshu Wang/Reuters] How did Musk react after the results were announced? After the announcement, Musk climbed on stage and danced while investors chanted his name. He expressed triumph, as well as appreciation for the shareholders after the vote tally. \u201cI super appreciate it,\u201d he told the shareholders. \u201cFantastic group of shareholders. Hang on to your Tesla stock,\u201d Musk said. \u201cOther shareholder meetings are like snoozefests, but ours are bangers. I mean, look at this. This is sick,\u201d Musk said. Advertisement Musk pledged to start production of a two-seater steering-less robotaxi called a \u201cCybercab\u201d in April. He also promised to unveil Tesla\u2019s next-generation Roadster electric sports car. He added that Tesla will need to acquire large-scale chip manufacturing capabilities to support its move into artificial intelligence (AI). For this, the company may consider collaborating with Intel, one of the world\u2019s largest semiconductor companies. Optimus, unveiled as a prototype by the company in 2022, is designed to be an \u201cautonomous humanoid robot\u201d performing \u201cunsafe, repetitive or boring tasks.\u201d \u201cWhat we are about to embark upon is not merely a new chapter of the future of Tesla, but a whole new book,\u201d Musk told a crowd of cheering stakeholders. What goals does Musk have to achieve in order to be paid? In order to get the pay package, Musk needs to meet a series of operational goals. This includes manufacturing 20 million vehicles over the next decade, and bringing 1 million operational robotaxis to the roads. He must attract 10 million subscriptions to Tesla\u2019s Full Self-Driving feature on its cars. He must also generate profits of up to $400bn. Another condition is that Tesla\u2019s market valuation must continue to rise above its current $1.5 trillion and reach set milestones, which start at $2 trillion. After that, he must raise the valuation by nine tranches each of $500bn until the market valuation reaches $8.5 trillion by 2035. The board\u2019s proposal states that Musk would have to \u201ccompletely transform Tesla and society as we know it\u201d and he would get \u201czero\u201d unless he meets the \u201cincredibly ambitious\u201d goals. However, an analysis by the Reuters news agency, which weighed Musk\u2019s performance goals, as well as insights from more than a dozen experts, found that Musk could still be paid more than $50bn by achieving just some of the board\u2019s goals. The deal also ties Musk to Tesla for the next 10 years. The proposal was contentious, with some investors opposing it because of its massive scale. However, the Tesla board warned that Musk might leave the company if the vote did not pass. Board members said the 75 percent vote in favour of the pay deal demonstrated investor confidence in the long-term leadership by Musk, who has ambitions to move further into AI \u2013 particularly by making progress with the Optimus robot, which was un",

Win McNamee/Getty Images Elon Musk turned off many potential buyers of his Tesla cars and sent sales plunging with his foray into politics . But the stock has soared anyway and now he wants the company to pay him more \u2014 a lot more. Recommended Video Shareholders gathering Thursday for Tesla\u2019s annual meeting in Austin, Texas, will decide in a proxy vote whether to grant Musk, the company\u2019s CEO and already the richest person in the world , enough stock to potentially make him history\u2019s first trillionaire. It\u2019s a vote that has sparked heated debate on both sides of the issue, even drawing the pope\u2019s comments on it as an example of income inequality . Several pension funds have come out against the package, arguing that the board of directors is too beholden to Musk, his behavior too reckless lately and the riches offered too much. Supporters say Musk is a genius who is the only person capable of ushering in a Tesla-dominated future in which hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars \u2014 many without steering wheels \u2014 will ferry people and humanoid Tesla robots will march around factories and homes, picking up boxes and watering plants. The pay is necessary to incentivize him, they say, and keep him focused. Musk has threatened to walk away from the company if he doesn\u2019t get what he wants and has blasted some of the package\u2019s critics as \u201ccorporate terrorists.\u201d What is up for a vote To get his Tesla shares, Musk has to secure approval from a majority of the company\u2019s voting shareholders. Improving the odds, Musk gets to vote his own shares, worth 15% of the company. Shareholders first heard about the pay package in September when the board of directors proposed it in a detailed filing to federal securities regulators. The document, running 200 pages, also contains other proposals up for a vote at the meeting, including whether to allow Tesla to invest in another Musk company, xAI, and who should serve on the board in the future. How Musk can get $1 trillion Musk won\u2019t necessarily get all of that money, or even a cent of it, if the package is approved. He first has to meet several operational and financial targets. To get the full pay, for instance, he has to deliver to the car market 20 million Teslas over 10 years, more than double the number he has churned out over the past dozen years. He also has to massively increase the market value of the company and its operating profits and deliver one million robots, from zero today. If he falls short of the biggest goals, though, the package could still hand him plenty of money. Musk will get $50 billion in additional Tesla shares, for example, if he increases the company\u2019s market value by 80%, something he did just this past year, as well as doubling vehicle sales and tripling operating earnings \u2014 or hitting any other two of a dozen operational targets. Musk vs. Rockefeller Musk is already the richest man in the world with a net worth of $493 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and well ahead of some of the wealthiest of years past. The steel giant, Andrew Carnegie, was once worth an inflation-adjusted $300 billion, according to the Carnegie Corp., well below Musk\u2019s wealth. Musk is still trailing John D. Rockefeller, but he\u2019s closing in fast. The railroad titan hit peak inflation-adjusted wealth of $630 billion in 1913, according to Guinness World Records. For his part, Musk says it\u2019s not really about the money but about getting a higher Tesla stake \u2014 it will double to nearly 30% \u2014 so he can control the company. He says that\u2019s a pressing concern given Tesla\u2019s future \u201crobot army,\u201d a reference to the company\u2019s Optimus humanoid workers that he doesn\u2019t trust anyone else to control. Split among shareholders Many investors have come out in support of the package, including Baron Capital Management, whose founder called Musk indispensable to the company. \u201cWithout his relentless drive and uncompromising standards,\u201d wrote founder Ron Baron, \u201cthere would be no Tesla.\u201d Critics include the biggest in the U.S. public pension fund, Calpers, and Norway\u2019s sovereign wealth fund , the world\u2019s largest. They argue the pay is excessive, with the Norway fund expressing concern that the board that designed it, which incl",

But the stock has soared anyway and now he wants the company to pay him more \u2014 a lot more. Shareholders gathering Thursday for Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas, will decide in a proxy vote whether to grant Musk, the company's CEO and already the richest person in the world, enough stock to potentially make him history's first trillionaire. It's a vote that has sparked heated debate on both sides of the issue, even drawing the pope's comments on it as an example of income inequality. Several pension funds have come out against the package, arguing that the board of directors is too beholden to Musk, his behavior too reckless lately and the riches offered too much. Supporters say Musk is a genius who is the only person capable of ushering in a Tesla-dominated future in which hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars \u2014 many without steering wheels \u2014 will ferry people and humanoid Tesla robots will march around factories and homes, picking up boxes and watering plants.

Improving the odds, Musk gets to vote his own shares, worth 15% of the company. Shareholders first heard about the pay package in September when the board of directors proposed it in a detailed filing to federal securities regulators. The document, running 200 pages, also contains other proposals up for a vote at the meeting, including whether to allow Tesla to invest in another Musk company, xAI, and who should serve on the board in the future. Musk won't get necessarily get all of that money, or even a cent of it, if the package is approved. He first has to meet several operational and financial targets. To get the full pay, for instance, he has to deliver to the car market 20 million Teslas over 10 years, more than double the number he has churned out over the past dozen years. He also has to massively increase the market value of the company and its operating profits and deliver one million robots, from zero today. If he falls short of the biggest goals, though, the package could still hand him plenty of money. Musk will get $50 billion in additional Tesla shares, for example, if he increases the company's market value by 80%, something he did just this past year, as well as doubling vehicle sales and tripling operating earnings \u2014 or hitting any other two of a dozen operational targets. Musk is already the richest man in the world with a net worth of $493 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and well ahead of some of the wealthiest of years past.

Debate over his Tesla pay package rages SECTIONS Musk the trillionaire? Debate over his Tesla pay package rages AP Last Updated: Nov 06, 2025, 07:54:00 AM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Tesla investors are currently weighing in on a monumental compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk, a move that could potentially crown him as the first trillionaire in history. Advocates assert that Musk's visionary leadership is crucial for steering Tesla forward, even with ambitious projects like a robot army on the horizon. AP FILE - Elon Musk Elon Musk turned off many potential buyers of his Tesla cars and sent sales plunging with his foray into politics. But the stock has soared anyway and now he wants the company to pay him more -- a lot more. Shareholders gathering on Thursday for Tesla's annual meeting in Austin, Texas, will decide in a proxy vote whether to grant Musk, the company's CEO and already the richest person in the world, enough stock to potentially make him history's first trillionaire. It's a vote that has sparked heated debate on both sides of the issue, even drawing the pope's comments on it as an example of income inequality. Several pension funds have come out against the package, arguing that the board of directors is too beholden to Musk, his behaviour too reckless lately and the riches offered too much. Supporters say Musk is a genius who is the only person capable of ushering in a Tesla-dominated future in which hundreds of thousands of self-driving Tesla cars -- many without steering wheels -- will ferry people and humanoid Tesla robots will march around factories and homes, picking up boxes and watering plants. The pay is necessary to incentivise him, they say, and keep him focused. Live Events Musk has threatened to walk away from the company if he doesn't get what he wants and has blasted some of the package's critics as \u201ccorporate terrorists\". What is up for a vote To get his Tesla shares, Musk has to secure approval from a majority of the company's voting shareholders. Improving the odds, Musk gets to vote his own shares, worth 15 per cent of the company. Shareholders first heard about the pay package in September when the board of directors proposed it in a detailed filing to federal securities regulators. The document, running 200 pages, also contains other proposals up for a vote at the meeting, including whether to allow Tesla to invest in another Musk company, xAI, and who should serve on the board in the future. How Musk can get USD 1 trillion Musk won't necessarily get all of that money, or even a cent of it, if the package is approved. He first has to meet several operational and financial targets. To get the full pay, for instance, he has to deliver to the car market 20 million Teslas over 10 years, more than double the number he has churned out over the past dozen years. He also has to massively increase the market value of the company and its operating profits and deliver one million robots, from zero today. If he falls short of the biggest goals, though, the package could still hand him plenty of money. Musk will get USD 50 billion in additional Tesla shares, for example, if he increases the company's market value by 80 per cent, something he did just this past year, as well as doubling vehicle sales and tripling operating earnings -- or hitting any other two of a dozen operational targets. Musk vs Rockefeller Musk is already the richest man in the world with a net worth of USD 493 billion, according to Forbes magazine, and well ahead of som",

Log in Lights off Norway urged to tap \u20ac1.8tn fund to help EU unlock Ukraine loan After a Danish newspaper revived a once far-fetched proposal, the idea has since gained traction among Norwegian parties Politics Jacob Wulff Wold Euractiv Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and Norwegian Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Store. (Photo by Maxym Marusenko/NurPhoto via Getty Images) Calls are mounting for Norway to use its \u20ac1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund to help move forward the EU\u2019s stalled \u20ac140 billion loan for Ukraine, after a Danish newspaper revived a once far-fetched idea during last month\u2019s EU leaders\u2019 meeting. Five Norwegian political parties, including three backing Labour Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re\u2019s next government, have now urged Oslo to step in to overcome Belgium\u2019s concerns about using immobilised Russian sovereign assets to fund a \u20ac140 billion reparation loan to Kyiv. EU leaders discussed the issue on 23 October at a summit in Brussels, without reaching an agreement, as Belgium insists that other EU countries must share the legal and financial risks associated with the plan before it agrees to proceed. The assets are held by Euroclear, a Brussels-based clearing house. \u2018I\u2019m not a bad boy\u2019: Belgium\u2019s De Wever defends Ukraine loan veto Economy Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever has fiercely defended his country\u2019s refusal to back a\u2026 3 minutes Last week, St\u00f8re ordered a \u201cfull review\u201d of Norway\u2019s possible involvement. Oil-rich Norway is sitting on the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund, worth \u20ac1.8 trillion, including an estimated \u20ac109 billion earned from soaring gas prices in 2022 and 2023 following Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine. \u201cWe are paying close attention and are continuing our dialogue with EU colleagues,\u201d state secretary at the Norwegian finance ministry, Ellen Reitan, told Euractiv. The comments come as EU countries are eyeing Russian frozen assets rather than their own budgets to meet Kyiv\u2019s financial needs, which the International Monetary Fund estimates are around \u20ac55 billion for the next two years. Brussels intends to present options to finance Ukraine\u2019s needs but will \u201cintensify discussions with like-minded partners and allies \u2026 at a later stage\u201d, a European Commission spokesperson told Euractiv. Politiken activism The push for Norway\u2019s involvement, however, did not originate in Brussels or Oslo but in Copenhagen. As EU leaders gathered in Brussels to discuss the loan on 23 October, Politiken published an interview with two Norwegian economists urging their country to use its vast wealth and triple-A credit rating to break the impasse . \u201cThat would be great,\u201d said Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen when a Politiken reporter asked her about it some hours later in Brussels, but added that she hadn\u2019t heard anything suggesting Oslo was considering the idea. The same reporter later asked Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy whether he had discussed the proposal with the Norwegian leader St\u00f8re during their meeting earlier that week. \u201cI spoke with Jonas mostly about gas,\u201d Zelenskyy said, seeming confused. Both exchanges were picked up by Politico and Norwegian media, prompting smaller Norwegian parties to jump on the peripheral idea. There is still no sign that Norway will take a leading role in the stalled loan plan, though it could join as one of several backers. \u201cNorwegian conservatives are positive, but this should happen together with EU countries,\u201d former foreign minister Ine Eriksen S\u00f8reide said. Politiken did not respond to Euractiv\u2019s request for comment.

Photograph: Stian Lysberg/Getty Images Richard Milne Wed Nov 05 2025 - 13:05 \u2022 3 MIN READ Norway has suspended its ethical investing rules to avoid its $2.1 trillion (\u20ac1.8 trillion) oil fund being forced to sell out of Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet due to their work for the Israeli government, according to its influential finance minister. Jens Stoltenberg said that the US had publicly conveyed its concerns after the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund sold out of Caterpillar after its bulldozers were used in the Palestinian territories. Norway\u2019s centre-left government pushed an urgent proposal through parliament on Tuesday, putting the work of the independent ethics council on hold. Mr Stoltenberg said the ethics council had planned soon to look into technology companies such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google owner Alphabet, as well as those on a UN blacklist issued in July.

Housing stuck at the bottom of planning priorities The report, by United Nations (UN) special rapporteur Francesca Albanese, states that the three tech giants \u201cgrant Israel virtually governmentwide access to their cloud and artificial intelligence technologies, enhancing data processing, decision-making and surveillance and analysis capacities\u201d. Mr Stoltenberg said: \u201cIt is obvious that there is a possibility that the existing framework can lead to a decision by an independent body to withdraw from some of the largest companies in the world. That would undermine the purpose of the fund to be a broad, diversified global investment fund.\u201d Tom O\u2019Brien of Nephin Energy on the importance of gas, the potential of biomethane, and whether our energy bills will come down Listen | 38:22 The oil fund has faced a tumultuous few months over its holdings in Israel, leading it to sell out of half of its Israeli holdings as well as Caterpillar under heavy political and public pressure in Norway over the war in Gaza. The existing arrangement has involved the oil fund\u2019s ethics council giving recommendations on whether to sell out of a specific company to Norway\u2019s central bank, which houses the fund and takes the final decision on whether to divest. Mr Stoltenberg said he was worried that selling out of one of the US tech giants \u2013 the biggest seven of which make up more than 15 per cent of the fund\u2019s equity holdings \u2013 would harm its status as an index fund and threaten Norway\u2019s welfare state.

From the capital No wonder EU countries are eyeing Russian assets rather than coughing up to meet Ukraine\u2019s multibillion-euro needs. EU finances are in such bad shape that the International Monetary Fund on Tuesday urged states to rethink their social contract to avoid \u201cexplosive\u201d debt levels, as my colleague Thomas M\u00f8ller-Nielsen reported . But as our resident Norseman Jacob Wulff Wold tells me, up in oil-rich Norway, politicians are pressing the government to crack open the \u20ac1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund to support Ukraine and guarantee the EU\u2019s stalled plan. This would be music to the ears of the EU, whose makeshift \u20ac140 billion reparations loan using Russian assets has been stalled by Belgium, which wants financial guarantees from other EU states. Five political parties \u2013 including three of the four supporting Labour Prime Minister Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re \u2013 have called for Norway to underwrite the Ukraine loan. The country is sitting pretty on \u20ac109 billion made from gas price hikes triggered by Putin\u2019s war in 2022-23. On Tuesday, Oslo announced another $7 billion for Ukraine\u2019s defence in 2026. So, Norway: saviour of Ukraine and a paralysed EU? Not so fast. St\u00f8re has requested a \u201cfull review\u201d of Norway\u2019s potential involvement. \u201cWe are paying close attention and are continuing our dialogue with EU colleagues,\u201d the finance ministry told Jacob. By the way, the push originated not in Oslo or Brussels but in Copenhagen. In February, Danish daily Politiken branded Norway\u2019s Ukraine support as \u201cpathetic.\u201d It published an interview on 23 October with two Norwegian economists urging Oslo to use its wealth and triple-A credit rating to resolve the reparations loan impasse . Ambassadors meet today to discuss Ukraine\u2019s dire finances \u2013 but there are signs of reality biting as the reparations loan is still being worked out in Brussels. German media reported on Tuesday that Friedrich Merz\u2019s government will put \u20ac3 billion in aid in 2026, though that\u2019s a drop in the ocean compared with Kyiv\u2019s needs. EU economy chief Valdis Dombrovskis said \u201cbridging solutions\u201d might be needed early next year to keep Ukraine afloat if the reparations loan remains stalled. Ukraine, which plans to use the reparations loan to buy home-made weapons, got a warning about defence corruption in the Commission\u2019s latest enlargement report, which flagged \u201cinstances of political interference\u201d in the governance of its two procurement agencies. Talking of seizing money Former EU Justice Commissioner Didier Reynders has been charged with money laundering and other potential offences, following questioning by a Belgian investigating judge last month, according to multiple media reports. Belgian authorities raided his home last December, shortly after his term as commissioner ended.

( Reuters: Kai Pfaffenbach ) abc.net.au/news/lessons-for-australia-from-norways-tax-on-resources/105939048 Link copied Share Share article Norway is renowned for ranking among the happiest and wealthiest countries around the globe \u2014 a standard of living partially bankrolled by the world's largest sovereign wealth fund. The $US2.144 trillion ($3.253 trillion) fund booked a $US102.56 billion ($157.04 billion) profit in the third quarter \"driven by strong returns in the stock market, particularly in basic materials, telecommunications and the financial sector\". It has stakes in real estate, renewable energy infrastructure and global equities. More than 8,300 companies are on the equities investments list in countries ranging alphabetically from Australia to Vietnam. From the Commonwealth Bank to Bega Cheese, Norway's sovereign wealth fund has about $33.6 billion worth of investments in more than 300 Australian companies. And it all started with oil. Almost a quarter of Norway's national budget is funded through the sovereign wealth fund. A floating offshore oil production vessel and an offshore wind converter platform sit in the Aibel yard in Haugesund, Norway. ( Reuters: Nora Buli ) The small Nordic nation with a population of about 5 million people is among few OECD nations with completely free higher education. On average, it spends more than other developed nations on services such as health and education. Since the mid 1990s, Norway has imposed a 56 per cent \"special tax\" for oil and gas companies, alongside a 22 per cent corporate tax rate. The proceeds from the tax have been reinvested in its sovereign wealth fund, which is now the largest in the world. Norway's Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, said the sovereign wealth fund was about transferring the values under its seabed into a financial mechanism for its future generations. \"[Now] the financial investment is made not dominantly by the income from energy,\" he told the Rest is Politics podcast in September. How Australia and Norway compare In 1969, Norway discovered one of the world's largest offshore oilfields in the North Sea. Initially, foreign companies held responsibility for developing the first gas and oil fields. But the Norwegian government later took a bigger stake in the proceeds from its resources, gaining a 50 per cent ownership interest in every production licence. By 1996, the government had established its sovereign wealth fund. It now owns almost 1.5 per cent of all shares in the world's listed companies. Decades on, the revenue from oil and gas make up less than half of the value of the fund with the bulk of it coming from investments in equities, real estate and renewable energy infrastructure. Australia's sovereign wealth fund, the Future Fund, is ranked about 16th behind other fossil fuel rich nations such as Norway, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. How does Australia tax its resources? Australia introduced the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax (PRRT) in the late 1980s, replacing the federal royalties scheme. It is a federal tax levied on petroleum, oil and gas projects in Australian Commonwealth waters. It only applies to profits from the sale of petroleum products such as stabilised crude oil, liquefied petroleum gas, ethane and shale oil. Other minerals, iron ore and coal are not covered. Profits are taxed at 40 per cent but companies may deduct certain expenses and carry forward losses to future income years. It has been described as \"broken\" , even after recent changes from the Commonwealth. Those changes were announced two years ago. But in June, the rework of the tax according to budget forecasts was expected to raise $4 billion less than when it was first announced. It is also forecast to rai",

Jamie Dimon says he\u2019ll \u2018call him and offer my help\u2019 By Diane Brady Diane Brady Executive Editorial Director, Fortune Live Media and author of CEO Daily By Diane Brady Diane Brady Executive Editorial Director, Fortune Live Media and author of CEO Daily November 4, 2025, 4:04 AM ET Add us on Democratic New York City mayoral candidate Zohran Mamdani speaks during a campaign event in New York on November 3, 2025. ANGELA WEISS/AFP via Getty Images In today\u2019s CEO Daily: Diane Brady previews election day in New York City. The big story: OpenAI\u2019s $38 billion AWS deal. The markets: Down across the board. Plus: All the news and watercooler chat from Fortune . Good morning. It\u2019s election day here in New York City. President Donald Trump has endorsed former New York Governor Andrew Cuomo for mayor, calling on New Yorkers to defeat \u201cCommunist\u201d Zohran Mamdani in a post on Truth Social. But in my conversations with business leaders over the past few weeks, I\u2019ve sensed a more nuanced stance on the 34-year-old Democratic Socialist who\u2019s now leading in the polls. As one Wall Street executive pointed out to me in Miami: \u201cHe\u2019s changed his mind on some things (such as defunding the police) and he needs to get support on others (such as raising state tax rates), so let\u2019s see how he operates.\u201d Recommended Video Here are some issues on the radar for business: Tax Hikes \u2013 Mamdani has said he can raise $10 billion through a 2% income tax surcharge on salaries over $1 million, raising the state\u2019s top corporate tax rate to 11.5%, transforming procurement and collecting almost $700 million that the city is owed. But Mamdani himself has admitted that the bulk of these moves require legislative action beyond his control. Business Exodus \u2013 Dave Portnoy of Barstool Sports has threatened to move his New York City headquarters if Mamdani is elected. That would impact a little more than 300 people. But Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan, which has 24,000 employees in the city, recently told Fortune editor-in-chief Alyson Shontell that he\u2019d help Mamdani or any mayor who wins the election. \u201cYou know, we survived [Mayor] Bill de Blasio,\u201d he said. \u201cNew York will survive.\u201d City-run Stores \u2013 If you want to bet on the prospects for Mamdani\u2019s plan to open a government-run grocery store in every borough, talk to one of my favorite people to interview: John Catsimatidis, who runs Gristedes and D\u2019Agostino Supermarkets in New York. Opening a business with 2% margins in a city that already gets top scores for equitable access to groceries sounds like a losing proposition. Catsimatidis has threatened to close stores if Mamdani wins. Maybe he\u2019ll go back to his earlier offer to give the mayor a store to run. Real Estate \u2013 Mamdani\u2019s promise of a rent freeze for 2 million New Yorkers in rent-stabilized apartments means a rent hike for everyone else. That, plus the prospect of tax hikes, is reviving interest in real estate in the city\u2019s affluent suburbs. But affordability is a real issue as CEOs have told me it\u2019s harder to attract talent to the city because of the cost of living, especially for startups and industries like fashion and advertising that can\u2019t offer Wall Street salaries. Gen Z \u2013 Frustrated over housing costs, career opportunities and more, young New Yorkers want to change the status quo. That\u2019s not unique to New York, of course, and CEOs are concerned that the next generation of leaders doesn\u2019t trust that business or government is on their side. If Mamdani can ignite enthusiasm for civic engagement among Gen Z, that could be a boon for everyone. Just a reminder to join my colleagues Geoff Colvin and Sheryl Estrada for a conversation on \u201cOptimizing for a Human\u2013Machine Workforce,\u201d next Thursday, Nov. 13, from 11:00 AM to 12:00 Noon ET.

Read Today's Paper Norway wealth fund to vote no on Musk $1 trillion Tesla pay package SECTIONS Norway wealth fund to vote no on Musk $1 trillion Tesla pay package Reuters Last Updated: Nov 04, 2025, 01:04:00 PM IST Rate Story Follow us Share Font Size Abc Small Abc Medium Abc Large Save Print Comment Synopsis Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, will vote against Elon Musk's proposed $1 trillion Tesla compensation package. The fund cited concerns over the award's size, potential dilution, and insufficient mitigation of key person risk. Shareholders will decide on the deal, potentially the largest CEO compensation ever, on November 6. AP Norway's sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, said on Tuesday it would vote against ratifying Tesla CEO Elon Musk's proposed compensation package, containing shares worth up to $1 trillion, at an annual general meeting this week. Investors in the electric-vehicle maker will decide on November 6 whether to approve the package, likely the largest-ever CEO compensation agreement , which critics have called excessive. So far, the Norwegian wealth fund is the largest outside Tesla investor to say how it plans to vote. The next-largest to do so, Baron Capital, on Monday said it would back Musk's pay package. The company's largest institutional investors, including BlackRock, Vanguard and State Street, have yet to disclose their voting plans. PRAISING VALUE CREATION, BUT CONCERNED WITH OVERALL SIZE Tesla's board is pushing for shareholders to approve the plan, with Chair Robyn Denholm warning last week that Musk could leave the company if the deal is rejected. Live Events While the package could grant stock worth up to $1 trillion over 10 years, the cost of those shares at the time of the award will be deducted, making the value to Musk slightly lower, at up to $878 billion, according to a Reuters analysis. \"While we appreciate the significant value created under Mr. Musk's visionary role, we are concerned about the total size of the award, dilution, and lack of mitigation of key person risk - consistent with our views on executive compensation,\" Norges Bank Investment Management said on its website. The fund, Tesla's seventh-biggest owner with a 1.12% stake worth $17 billion, also voted \"no\" to Musk's previous compensation plan, drawing a sharp response from the CEO, who turned down an invitation to a conference in Oslo. Various groups have tried and failed to block record payouts to Musk, including a $56 billion compensation plan for 2018 that investors reapproved last year, though legal challenges remain. NBIM on Tuesday also said it would vote against two out of three Tesla directors who are up for reelection, declining to back board veterans Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Ira Ehrenpreis while supporting Joe Gebbia, who joined in 2022. The $2.1 trillion Norwegian fund also said it would vote against Tesla's proposed general stock compensation plan, which is intended for all employees and can also be used by the board to benefit Musk. Tesla says its CEO will earn \"nothing\" unless the company's market value grows substantially and that the maximum award is only paid if the group reaches several milestones, most notably a market value of $8.5 trillion, a near six-fold increase. Yet Musk could still reap tens of billions of dollars without meeting many of those targets, according to experts in executive pay, company valuations, robotics and automotive trends.

Sequoia Capital Global Equities , which invests across late-stage private and public companies globally, has been allotted shares in the anchor round ahead of the investment platform\u2019s initial public offering, these people said. Other global funds like White Oak, Mirae, Wellington, as well as domestic institutions such as SBI Mutual Fund and HDFC Mutual Fund also participated in the anchor round, they said. Sovereign funds of Norway and Abu Dhabi were also among them, said one of the people. Around 55-60 investors had bid for a share of the anchor book, these people said. Domestic investors accounted for 57% of the anchor portion, while foreign investors subscribed to 43%, said another person. Groww and Sequoia Capital did not respond to queries.

ETtech Sequoia Capital exited its India and China businesses in 2023. Sequoia India was subsequently rebranded as Peak XV Partners. Groww\u2019s Rs 6,632 crore initial public offering comprises a fresh issue of Rs 1,060 crore and an offer for sale of 557 million shares by existing shareholders, including Peak XV Partners Investments, Y Combinator and Ribbit Capital. The price band has been fixed at Rs 95-100 per share for the IPO that opens Tuesday. The firm is targeting to go public at a valuation of $7 billion. Microsoft chief executive officer Satya Nadella had picked up a stake in Groww in his personal capacity in 2022. Founded in 2016 by ex-Flipkart executives Lalit Keshre, Harsh Jain, Neeraj Singh and Ishan Bansal, Groww has expanded from a mutual fund discovery app into a full-stack investment platform offering equities, derivatives, mutual funds and fixed-income products. The company posted a net profit of Rs 1,819 crore on revenue of Rs 4,056 crore in FY2025. It is the largest stockbroker in the country in terms of active clients. It has more than 18 million registered users. Groww CEO Lalit Keshre told ET during a recent interaction that the company would use funds from the sale of fresh shares for brand building, strengthen the product and also go deeper into lending, like margin trade funding.

IPO size reduction: We have priced ourselves such that there is positivity around the IPO, and the entire community is incentivised to come on board as investors. The offer-for-sale (OFS) component shrank because there was no supply from my investors. As for the primary portion, our financials have improved over the past few quarters. We are PAT positive, and our net outstanding debt is down, so we could reduce that component.

Pine Labs has created an employee stock option (Esop) pool worth Rs 1,360 crore . By June 2025, it had granted 61.5 million options, valued at the same amount as the highest IPO price.

Join now The Highlight The Highlight The most likely AI apocalypse How artificial intelligence could be leading most humans into an inescapable trap. by Eric Levitz Nov 4, 2025, 11:00 AM UTC Share Gift Isabel Seliger for Vox Eric Levitz is a senior correspondent at Vox. He covers a wide range of political and policy issues with a special focus on questions that internally divide the American left and right. Before coming to Vox in 2024, he wrote a column on politics and economics for New York Magazine. Over the past year, I\u2019ve had many disquieting realizations \u2014 that the American voter is more forgiving of insurrections than inflation, that being 37 means having one bad knee (and another not particularly good one), and that the New York Mets made a pact with Satan in the fall of 1986, for which subsequent generations of fans would eternally pay . But my most unsettling epiphany may have been this: Robots can now do much of my job better than I can. For a decade, I have made a living partly by synthesizing news articles and academic studies into accessible explainers, which white-collar workers could skim while pretending to do their jobs. The skills that this vocation requires \u2014 the capacity to rapidly digest text, craft clean copy, and sound like I know more about any given subject than I actually do \u2014 are ones that ChatGPT possesses in spades. Worse, it can exercise these abilities far more efficiently than I can. ChatGPT requires five seconds and a speck of electricity to explain how President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs have impacted the dollar. To perform the same task, I need about 48 hours, six meals, 37 Twitter breaks, and at least three medications. And unlike myself, the chatbot can instantly rewrite its analysis in the voice of a pirate . But journalists are hardly alone in fearing our impending economic obsolescence (which is, admittedly, a longstanding pastime within the field ). Knowledge-workers of all kinds \u2014 from software engineers to financial analysts to filmmakers \u2014 are sweating their robo-competition. And not without reason. In investor calls, executives are touting plans to satisfy their labor needs with artificial intelligence at a historically high rate. Goldman Sachs is slowing hiring and speeding AI deployment. The fintech firm Klarna has used AI to slash its payroll by 40 percent . Salesforce says machines can now perform 50 percent of the firm\u2019s work . AI-generated mass unemployment is still the stuff of science fiction. But the technology does appear to be slowing hiring in heavily exposed fields, particularly for junior positions. And labor market data indicates that something weird is afoot: Over the past 35 years, recent college graduates have almost always had a lower unemployment rate than American workers writ large. Now, a young college grad is more likely to be involuntarily jobless than the typical US worker. Meanwhile, the major AI labs are promising to deliver an artificial general intelligence (AGI) \u2014 which is to say, a machine that can outperform humans at all cognitive tasks \u2014 in the near future. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei says AI is likely to wipe out half of all entry-level white-collar jobs by 2030. Investors seem to be betting a lot of money on such outcomes. This year alone, companies are poised to sink $375 billion into AI infrastructure. Among anxious laptop workers, these trends have fed half-ironic chatter about the coming of a \u201c permanent underclass \u201d: Once AI renders virtually all human labor commercially useless, most people will be condemned to eternal subjugation and precarity. No company will pay you for work that a robot can do better. And no market economy will let you climb the income ladder if your labor has no value. In Silicon Valley, such reasoning has generated a peculiarly dystopian variant of hustle culture : Make your fortune in the next five years, and you\u2019ll claim a place in the perpetual aristocracy of AI owners \u2014 fail, and you\u2019ll forever be at their mercy. All these claims are wildly speculative. It\u2019s not certain that today\u2019s AI labs have functioning business models , much less the wherewithal to develop omnicompetent ",

Listen 0:00 3521 News COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED The Norwegian Tax Administration said more people declared cryptocurrency holdings in 2024 than in the previous year, following efforts to increase reporting. In a Tuesday notice, Norway\u2019s tax authority said more than 73,000 people in the country reported owning some form of cryptocurrency in their 2024 returns. The numbers marked about a 30% increase year-over-year from crypto holdings in 2023, and significantly more than in 2019, when only 6,470 people in the country of 5.5 million people declared having digital assets. \u201cIt is gratifying that more people are reporting that they own cryptocurrency, and in this way ensuring that the tax is correct,\u201d said tax director Nina Schanke Funnemark. \u201cWe have taken several measures in recent years to increase this number, and we see that these measures are having an effect.\u201d Number and value of crypto holdings declared on tax returns. Source: Norwegian Tax Administration The total amount of crypto reported from the 73,000 people in 2024 totaled more than $4 billion in holdings, representing about $550 million in gains and $290 million in losses. According to the tax authority, crypto exchange operators and custodians will be required to report certain information through third-party reporting starting in 2026.

Fortunately, having raked in tens of billions of dollars from the fallout of Russia's invasion, Norway could break the impasse. EDINBURGH/OSLO \u2013 While credit ratings are not commonly seen as a determining factor in war, that may have changed with Ukraine\u2019s struggle for survival against Russia\u2019s invading army. As the European Union works toward a mechanism to leverage frozen Russian sovereign assets for Ukraine\u2019s defense, the implied risks to some member countries\u2019 credit ratings have become a sticking point. But there is a simple way to get around the impasse. Toward Humanist Superintelligence JDawnInk/Getty Images Innovation 1 Toward Humanist Superintelligence Mustafa Suleyman warns against the creation of entirely unbounded, autonomous advanced AI systems. In Search of the AI Bubble\u2019s Economic Fundamentals Spencer Platt/Getty Images Longer Reads 5 In Search of the AI Bubble\u2019s Economic Fundamentals William H. Janeway explains why the sector might be better off if the reckoning comes sooner rather than after leverage piles up. Mamdani\u2019s Big Bet Andres Kudacki/Getty Images Politics 3 Mamdani\u2019s Big Bet Slavoj \u017di\u017eek thinks New York\u2019s incoming democratic-socialist mayor understands how American politics is changing. The EU\u2019s plan is to extend Ukraine an interest-free \u20ac140 billion ($163 billion) loan secured against immobilized Russian assets held by the Belgian central securities depository, Euroclear. But the scheme needs additional backing by sovereign guarantees, and therein lies the problem. For highly indebted EU member countries, including France , taking on additional contingent liabilities could pose a risk to sovereign credit ratings, with potentially costly implications for debt servicing. A loan for Ukraine thus hangs on reassuring member states that ratings agencies won\u2019t view their guarantees as accruing to their debts. The European Commission has responded to such concerns by structuring the guarantees as off-balance-sheet liabilities unless triggered, and has enhanced collective EU responsibility. But this has not assuaged Belgium\u2019s doubts as the holder of the Russian funds, and it may have introduced additional concerns as well. Fearing potential Russian lawsuits or claims against it in the future, the Belgian government insists on legally binding, EU-wide indemnity to cover the legal and financial risks associated with the loan, and to guarantee its full amount. But solidifying EU countries\u2019 national guarantees risks reversing some of the credit-rating assurances that France and others secured. This is no small matter, because a ratings downgrade would not only have a serious impact on their borrowing costs, but also could affect their ability to rearm as a part of Europe\u2019s joint defense build-up. Ensuring that the envisioned loan to Ukraine does not impinge on the continent\u2019s aggregate debt burden therefore is in everyone\u2019s interest. To that end, Norway, while not an EU member, could play a decisive role. It boasts the most solid AAA bond rating in Europe \u2013 and arguably anywhere \u2013 owing to its $2 trillion sovereign wealth fund and robust institutions. It could singlehandedly take on the contingent liability associated with fresh Ukrainian debt, and without a dent to its credit rating. In doing so, Norway\u2019s government would both strengthen Ukraine\u2019s defenses against a revanchist aggressor and reduce financial risks to its European allies\u2019 rearmament efforts. Although Norway\u2019s government already contributes financially to Ukraine\u2019s war effort, it has resisted calls to donate the \u20ac109 billion that it generated in excess natural-gas profits in 2022 and 2023. Yet these windfalls were a direct consequence of the spike in energy prices caused by Russia\u2019s war on Ukraine. By hoarding these profits, Norway\u2019s government turned the country into a war profiteer .

But in Norway, they weigh heavily on the national conscience Orlando Whitehead Opinion Opinion The town of Reine on Lofoten Islands, Norway. Credit: Getty To be born Norwegian is to be born lucky. In the \u201ccountries of the world\u201d edition of the popular game Top Trumps, Norway gets high scores for all manner of covetable resources: jaw-dropping nature, no end of log cabins, and a work-life balance that allows them to enjoy it all. Little wonder this has translated into consistent top-10 rankings on the World Happiness Report, low wealth inequality, and a strong satisfaction with the social contract. Norwegians have free education (including universities), first-class healthcare, and social security. What\u2019s not to like? To live in a land of plenty is one thing; it\u2019s a rare fortune for that land also to be judiciously governed. And it\u2019s here that Norway has really excelled, as it had the foresight not simply to profit from its vast oil and gas reserves, but to build the world\u2019s biggest sovereign wealth fund, worth almost \u20ac300,000 per citizen. The quality of life that this huge golden goose gifts its prosperous people is the envy of the world. But in recent months, the fund has become a target of criticism, rather than a source of contentment. Despite the efforts of the fund\u2019s managers to keep it beyond the turbulent realm of politics, public anger swelled when it emerged that the fund had earned millions from investments in a company maintaining Israeli fighter jets. Norwegians felt scandalised. The revelations have raised profound moral questions concerning Norway\u2019s complicity in war crimes, and derailed domestic politics in the process, Jacob Wulff Wold (Euractiv\u2019s resident Norwegian) explains . And although the peace deal between Israel and Hamas has broken the deadlock in the delicate government coalition, the line between money and morals will stay firmly fixed in the spotlight. There are plenty of proverbs that point to the pitfalls of having lots of money \u2013 grave warnings that much of the global populace never comes to realise.

Weber open to Metsola third term \u2013 EPP leader Manfred Weber has refused to commit to handing the presidency of the European Parliament to the socialists in 2027.

Log in Lights off Nordic noir: How Norway went from Israel\u2019s friend to its foe To outsiders, it may seem strange that Norwegians \u2013 prosperous, peaceful and geographically distant from the conflict \u2013 so often take positions that provoke their allies Long Read Politics [Photo by Eyad Zaro/Anadolu via Getty Images] Jacob Wulff Wold Euractiv OSLO \u2013 Norway\u2019s long and complicated entanglement with Middle East diplomacy resurfaced in recent days \u2013 not in Jerusalem or Gaza, but in the marble halls of its own parliament. The Gaza peace deal broke a political impasse in Oslo that had paralysed talks over how to use the country\u2019s \u20ac1.8 trillion sovereign wealth fund. The deal has once again reshaped the domestic politics of a nation that has spent decades seeing its global moral standing as inseparable from its efforts in the Middle East. Israel\u2019s war in Gaza \u2013 fought some 3,600 kilometres from Oslo \u2013 emerged as one of the defining issues in Norway\u2019s September election. The fighting, and the international outrage surrounding it, fuelled a fierce debate over whether Norway\u2019s giant oil fund should divest from companies tied to Israel\u2019s military operations. Under growing public and political pressure, the fund withdrew investments from 23 companies deemed directly or indirectly complicit in the war. The centre-left Labour Party won the election, but its fragile coalition quickly found itself hostage to the Socialist Left Party (SV), which refused to join budget negotiations unless the fund cut ties with a further 16 firms. That stand-off ended last week, when SV dropped its ultimatum after the announcement of the Gaza peace deal \u2013 and after securing a parliamentary resolution instructing the government to ensure Norway \u201cdoes not risk becoming complicit in violations of international law in Palestine\u201d. The move may ease tensions not only in Oslo but also in Washington. The US State Department had expressed concern in September over the fund\u2019s decision to divest from Caterpillar, the American construction company whose bulldozers are used by Israel. The decision, a department spokesperson told Euractiv in an emailed statement, \u201cappears to be based on illegitimate claims against Caterpillar and the Israeli government\u201d. A frayed friendship Last year, Israel recalled its ambassadors from Ireland, Spain, and Norway after the three countries jointly recognised Palestine. In a rare diplomatic rebuke, Israel revoked the accreditation of Norwegian diplomats and accused Oslo of aligning with Hamas. To outsiders, it may seem strange that Norwegians \u2013 prosperous, peaceful and geographically distant from the conflict \u2013 so often take positions that provoke their allies. But to Hilde Henriksen Waage, a historian at the Peace Research Institute Oslo, the current tensions are merely the latest chapter in a decades-long story. \u201cTwo foreign policy questions occupied Norwegians after the Second World War: NATO and Israel,\u201d Waage said in an interview. From admiration to disillusion For Norway\u2019s post-war Labour Party, which dominated national politics for much of the twentieth century, Israel was once viewed as a kindred experiment \u2013 \u201ca socialist paradise,\u201d Waage said \u2013 and the two Labour movements developed an unusually close bond. That warmth began to cool in the late 1970s, after the Iranian Revolution severed Israel\u2019s oil supply. Under American pressure, Norway agreed to sell oil to Israel but also sought assurances from Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine Liberation Organisation, that doing so would not make Norway an enemy of the Arab world. Arafat saw an opportunity. He asked Norway to use its connections in Israel to establish a secret diplomatic channel \u2013 a backdoor that would eventually lead to the 1993 Oslo Accords. \u201cSuddenly we were this important peace nation,\u201d Waage said. \u201cGetting access to Washington, being mentioned in Brussels.\u201d But the euphoria of the Oslo Accords gave way to decades of stalemate. As hopes for a two-state solution faded, so too did Norwegian patience. A nation that once admired Israel\u2019s resilience became increasingly sympathetic to the Palestinians \u2013 and frustrated with its own inability to deliver peace. The collapse of balance That uneasy balance was shattered after Hamas\u2019s 7 October 2023 attacks in Israel and the ensuing war in Gaza. Norway, Waage said, \u201crealised that the old diplomatic formula \u2013 being equally friendly with both sides \u2013 was a complete failure\u201d. \u201cInstead of talking to the stronger party, Israel,\u201d she",

CIOs must grasp its influence on markets, strategy and long-term business growth. Share this item with your network: By Mary K. Pratt Published: 20 Oct 2025 With talk of a U.S. sovereign wealth fund gaining traction, CIOs and business leaders must prepare for a new class of investor -- one that brings massive capital, long-term vision and geopolitical implications. And understanding how these government-backed investors operate is essential to anticipating market shifts and strategic opportunities. U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order to create a sovereign wealth fund (SWF) on Feb. 3, 2025. A SWF is a government-owned investment fund that invests in real financial assets -- such as stocks, bonds, real estate real estate. While several states have their own SWFs, this national fund would be a first; however, sovereign wealth funds are longstanding components of the global investment community. Executives across the tech landscape need to be mindful of what SWFs are, how they affect markets and how they could affect their own business strategies. \"This is an increasingly prevalent way for investment capital to be available,\" said Dera Nevin, a managing partner at FTI Consulting. \"Knowing whether that capital in their company and about these investments can help shape priorities and strategies.\" What are sovereign wealth funds? Sovereign wealth funds are government-owned investment vehicles -- either a central government or a subnational government -- and includes investments in foreign financial assets, according to the 2008 Santiago Principles , which was drafted by sovereign wealth fund officials. Governments establish these funds to achieve specific financial objectives. \"Think of a giant mutual fund or private equity fund that instead of being owned by individual investors is owned by a government,\" said Michael Herde, senior managing director at FTI Consulting. SWFs do not include public pension funds ultimately owned by the underlying policyholders. Nor do they include central bank reserve assets, which are not invested. There are more than 100 SWFs worldwide, and they manage more than $10 trillion, according to the nonprofit International Forum of Sovereign Wealth Funds. The Norway Government Pension Fund Global had more than $2 trillion in assets, making it the largest SWF in the world, according to fall 2025 data from the Sovereign Fund Wealth Institute. The China Investment Corp., Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, China's SAFE Investment Co. and Kuwait Investment Authority -- each with more than $1 trillion in assets -- rounded out the top five largest SWFs. The 10 largest funds make up nearly 80% of the SWF assets under management, according to IFSWF data. How do sovereign wealth funds work? SWF operate similarly to mutual funds or private equity funds. However, there are several key differences between sovereign wealth funds and other investment vehicles. One big difference is SWFs are owned by a government rather than individual investors or investment firms. Another difference is how SWFs raise money, target investments and manage investments, said Zeeshan Ahmedani, a partner at the law firm A&O Shearman. At their core, SWFs are pools of sovereign assets, with capital typically coming from the sale of natural resources -- such as oil and gas -- or revenue from exported manufactured goods and commodities, Ahmedani said. IFSWF has found that 45% of all SWFs are funded by revenue from natural resources. The larger, more sophisticated sovereign wealth funds operate like investment banks and have experts working in verticals of investment interest -- for example, investments in technology or specifically AI, Ahmedani said. And as is the case with other investment vehicles, these sovereign wealth funds are mandated to manage assets to generate long-term value. But governments also often use SWFs as tools to reach other objectives, Ahmedani said. Governments use these funds for the following reasons: To guard against shocks in the global economy. To support domestic economic agendas. To advance diplomatic goals. Many governments use their sovereign wealth funds to achieve more than one such objective. IFSWF found that 36.3% of SWFs have a savings mandate, 31.1% have a development/strate",

Trump emphasized a focus on brokering peace between Ukraine and Russia, with a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest in the coming weeks. Analysts in Ukraine expressed concerns to RFE/RL over Trump's apparent softened stance towards Russia and lack of concrete military aid. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy came to Washington hoping to get a commitment on new weapons, but instead met an American president newly intent on brokering a peace deal to end the more than three-year war in Ukraine. Zelenskyy left his October 17 meeting with US President Donald Trump without receiving much-sought Tomahawk cruise missiles . He now finds himself preparing for a new phase of US-led diplomacy as American and Russian officials lay the groundwork for a potential agreement at an upcoming summit between Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin in Budapest. \"Let both claim Victory, let History decide!\" Trump wrote on social media after his meeting with Zelenskyy, saying he had told both leaders this week that \"it is time to stop the killing, and make a DEAL!\" After the meeting, which Zelenskyy described as productive , the Ukrainian president spoke by phone with European leaders -- including European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, Finland 's president, and the prime ministers of Britain , Italy, Norway, and Poland -- and said he was counting on Trump to pressure Putin \"to stop this war.\" The European leaders reaffirmed their support for Kyiv on the call and said that they will continue work on developing a peace plan for Ukraine, as well as options to increase pressure on Moscow through sanctions and the use of frozen Russian state assets. \"The most important thing now is to protect as many lives as possible, ensure security for Ukraine, and strengthen us all in Europe. This is precisely what we are working towards,\" Zelenskyy later said about the call on his Telegram channel. But analysts and Ukrainian lawmakers told RFE/RL that the lack of a commitment on Tomahawk missiles, another summit between Putin and Trump, and the US president's apparent softening rhetoric towards Putin after spending weeks threatening sanctions and potential weapons deliveries has raised anxiety levels in Kyiv. While Volodymyr Dubovyk, associate professor of international relations at Odesa University, told RFE/RL that Trump's softening tone towards Ukraine compared to earlier meetings with Zelenskyy this year reflects a \"positive dynamic,\" others do not share his optimism. \"I am surprised to hear that my colleagues have high hopes for this season of negotiations,\" Solomiia Bobrovska, a Ukrainian lawmaker who sits on the parliament's National Security Committee, told RFE/RL, referring to the White House meeting and a summit slated for the coming weeks in Budapest. \"If we can shift Trump's complacency for Russia even a millimeter away and closer towards Ukraine, then that is will be good,\" she added. From Tomahawks To A Summit In Hungary A similar unease is shared by Oleksandr Sushko, the executive director of the Kyiv-based International Renaissance Foundation. \"Trump appears to be only partially on [Ukraine's] side,\" he told RFE/RL. \"Therefore, it is very important to remain sober and restrained here.\" In the weeks leading up to his meeting with Zelenskyy, Trump had mused about sending Kyiv Tomahawk missiles as he appeared to sour on Putin over his refusal to negotiate a deal to end the war. A key reason for Zelenskyy's hastily organized trip to Washington was the possibility of Ukraine receiving the missiles, which are capable of hitting targets at a distance of up to 2,500 kilometers. But an October 16 phone call between Putin and Trump, which occurred while the Ukrainian president was in transit to the United States, changed that with a future meeting between the two leaders set for the coming weeks in the Hungarian capital. At a press conference after his White House meeting, Zelenskyy was asked about the missiles and what he had been told by US officials. \"We want [them] very much... we need them,\" he said. \"Nobody canceled this dialogue, this topic.\" Later, Trump reiterated that he wants the United States to hold on to its weaponry. \"We want Tomahawks also. We don't want to be giving away things that we n",

Log in Lights off There are no good arguments against the Ukraine reparations loan Can we really allow member states to object to the Ukraine loan on the grounds that this would undermine their standing in the eyes of other dictatorships who wish to use their money-managing services? Jacob Funk Kirkegaard Opinion Opinion Russian forces carry out daily air, mortar, artillery, and, especially, FPV drone attacks on the city of Kostiantynivka, Ukraine on October 16, 2025. [Jose Colon/Anadolu via Getty Images] Like the preparation of sausages, war financing is a notoriously messy business that is best not studied too closely, to draw on an apocryphal quote from Bismarck. But as EU leaders debate a possible reparations loan to Ukraine, it is clear that \u201cTINA\u201d (\u201cthere is no alternative\u201d) is the only credible argument left. The loan comes with a number of compelling advantages. For starters, it can fund Ukraine for multiple years \u2013 at least the duration of the current IMF program through 2027, free of dependencies on Donald Trump. Furthermore, the cash is already available at the ECB, doing away with the need for new Eurobonds issued on the markets to finance the aid to Ukraine. And crucially, the loan is designed such that it directly links the Russian aggressor state to who pays for Ukraine\u2019s war effort in a way that will keep EU sanctions on Russia in place until Moscow agrees. Details must still be clarified, but arguments against the reparation loan are substantively weak . The Belgian government continues to hold out for firmer and clearer legal guarantees for what happens when Russia fails to pay reparations, as well as an explicit EU political declaration outlining the \u201cEuropean nature\u201d of the measures taken \u2013 presumably to offer Belgian voters a degree of reassurance against alleged risks of Russian hybrid retaliation. But such concerns \u2013 also shared by Luxembourg (home of ClearStream, Europe\u2019s other main international central securities depository) \u2013 risk becoming as much about protecting the EuroClear and Clearstream custodian franchises as about the credibility of the \u201cIOU\u201d given by the EU to these organisations for the cash sent to Kyiv. In principle, financial custodian services can be provided anywhere in the world. But they rely on the legal and political credibility of the custodian jurisdiction. But can we really allow member states to object to the Ukraine loan on the grounds that this would undermine their standing in the eyes of other dictatorships who wish to use their money-managing services? Similarly, the ECB\u2019s monetary mercantilist arguments about the \u201ceuro\u2019s global role and standing as a reserve currency\u201d are institutionally self-interested and willfully ignore the risks to financial stability that arise from a scenario in which Ukraine loses the war and Russia sets its sights on EU territory next. Sure, other G7 members \u2013 whose currencies the ECB see as competitors to the euro \u2013 could join any action the EU might take. But the only \u201clegal precedent\u201d that the proposed reparations loan will set is that states that invade democratic neighbours risk seeing money held in European financial institutions immobilised and channelled towards their victims\u2019 defence until war reparations are paid. This rationale is unlikely to affect many governments around the world. Of the large sovereign wealth funds or other government investment entities, Norway surely won\u2019t care, and nor will Japan. And since Ukraine\u2019s reparation loan isn\u2019t in response to domestic human rights concerns, Gulf region entities in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, or the UAE needn\u2019t worry either. In fact, the only country for which the implications of the reparations loan are relevant is China, which clearly has aspirations for its democratic neighbour in Taiwan. But keeping China happy surely can\u2019t prevent the EU from helping Ukraine. A detailed policy debate will be needed between the EU, Ukraine and the IMF about just how much money Ukraine will need in 2026 and 2027, and precisely how this money can be used. Kyiv will want free hands in spending the money, while the IMF will want to ensure at least a \u201cfig leaf of credibility\u201d for its forward-looking Ukrainian economic forecast. Different EU members may want to see Ukraine buy more European (rather than US) -made weapons, and EU leaders will want to ensure that funds lent to Ukraine go towards the war effort, rather than, say, repaying existing Ukrainian private bondholders. These are the debates ",

Discover which countries do this and why Rapid Read Rapid Read Summarized by AI. + Countries like Alaska, Finland, Iran, Macau, Hong Kong, Singapore, Canada, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Mongolia deposit large sums into citizens' bank accounts, funded by natural resource revenues.

Share Your Feedback Choose News18 on Google reset Direct cash transfers not only provide immediate relief to citizens but also serve as a tool for social welfare, poverty alleviation, and economic stimulus. One of the major reasons the NDA swept the 2025 Bihar elections is the popularity of the Nitish Kumar government\u2019s direct cash transfer schemes, under which amounts ranging from Rs 1,000 to Rs 10,000 were deposited into the accounts of farmers and women. Just before the elections, under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana, women received a pension of Rs 10,000, with a promise that the remaining Rs 1,90,000 would be disbursed in instalments. Recommended Stories However, direct cash transfers to citizens are not unique to India. In many countries, governments deposit large sums straight into the bank accounts of their people. Global Examples Of Direct Cash Transfers Alaska, USA: Every citizen receives a Permanent Fund Dividend regardless of the ruling party, sharing oil revenue directly with residents. Each person receives between $1,000 and $2,500 (approximately Rs 90,000 to Rs 2,70,000) per year. This model inspired several Universal Basic Income (UBI) experiments worldwide. Finland: From 2017 to 2018, 2,000 citizens received \u20ac560 per month for two years to study the effects of unconditional cash payments on employment and life quality. Iran: In 2010, after removing subsidies, the government began direct cash transfers of $40-$45 per person per month, creating the world\u2019s largest national cash transfer system. Macau: Annual payments of 7,000-10,000 Macanese Pataca are given from casino tax revenue. Hong Kong: Each adult resident received HKD 10,000 in a one-time scheme. Singapore: Citizens receive periodic cash payments, including SGD 600-1,200 (Rs 40,000-80,000) disbursed during Covid-19, with low-income residents continuing to receive regular support. Canada: Residents in the Yukon and Northwest Territories receive cash from energy subsidies occasionally. Saudi Arabia: Monthly cash payments from oil revenue are given to citizens, with amounts varying by family size. United Arab Emirates: Citizens receive allowances for housing, marriage, and monthly support, sometimes as direct deposits. Mongolia: Since 2010, citizens have received annual cash benefits of up to 100,000 tugrik per person from mineral and copper revenues. Why Govts Give Cash Directly To Citizens? Many countries provide direct cash transfers because they earn substantial revenue from natural resources like oil or minerals and share the benefits with citizens. Others, like Canada and Finland, implement Universal Basic Income schemes. Some countries, such as Iran, provide unconditional cash de",

The country\u2019s rich history, vibrant cities, and stunning islands have captured the attention of international travelers, establishing Greece as a leading destination on the global stage. With an influx of visitors and increased international recognition, this achievement underscores Greece\u2019s appeal and its ongoing efforts to enhance its tourism offerings and infrastructure. In 2024, Greece marked a remarkable achievement with revenues reaching \u20ac21.6 billion, which has been hailed as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d for the national economy. This impressive performance represents a key turning point, with current trends indicating that these figures will be surpassed in the coming months. The country\u2019s tourism sector is not only growing but also evolving. What stands out is that the growth in revenue is outpacing the increase in visitor numbers. This indicates a shift in the profile of travelers, with a greater influx of high-spending visitors who are choosing Greece for its rich cultural offerings, luxurious experiences, and improved services. The focus is now on attracting a more affluent demographic, which in turn supports Greece\u2019s efforts to enhance the quality and diversity of services across the country. Advertisement The growth in tourism revenue also highlights the significant investments that have been made in improving the country\u2019s infrastructure, facilities, and overall tourism offerings. The government\u2019s strategic approach appears to be paying off, with a focus on not just increasing the number of visitors, but ensuring that the tourism industry contributes positively to the national economy and to the local communities. On the global stage, Greece\u2019s position as one of the top ten travel destinations worldwide has added a further layer of optimism. The country\u2019s appeal is gaining more international recognition, with the latest reports showing that Greece continues to captivate travelers from around the world. This growing reputation is expected to boost visitor numbers even further, strengthening Greece\u2019s competitive position in the global tourism market. Advertisement In addition, high-level meetings with key players in the tourism industry, held in international hubs such as Riyadh and London, have further highlighted Greece\u2019s increasing importance as a destination. Major tour operators and airlines are not only enhancing their collaborations with Greece, but they are now looking to establish long-term agreements, further solidifying the country\u2019s status as a tourism leader. These moves align with the government\u2019s broader strategy to create a more stable and predictable tourism model that can sustain growth and keep the industry resilient in the face of global challenges. By nurturing lasting partnerships, Greece is positioning itself to remain a preferred destination for international travelers, ensuring that it remains competitive in an ever-evolving market. Simultaneously, the Greek government has been proactive in focusing on sustainability and inclusivity within the tourism sector. These efforts are particularly timely as the new Secretary-General of the World Tourism Organization has already initiated collaborations with Greece. Sustainability has become a central theme of these partnerships, with a shared commitment to ensuring that the tourism industry grows in an environmentally and socially responsible manner. Inclusivity has also been prioritized, with an emphasis on making tourism accessible to all, ensuring that the benefits of the sector reach a wide range of people across the country. Advertisement Within Greece itself, Thessaloniki is emerging as one of the most promising up-and-coming destinations in the country. The northern city is seeing a surge in interest from both travelers and airlines, which is indicative of its growing appeal as a major tourism hub. Thessaloniki\u2019s tourism infrastructure is improving rapidly, with new investments in both modern amenities and services.

Indonesia's TASPEN Fulfills Global Mandate, Delivering Full Benefits To Late Diplomat's Family Date 2025-11-17 11:10:56 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter ( MENAFN - ACN NewsWire) Indonesia's TASPEN Fulfills Global Mandate, Delivering Full Benefits to Late Diplomat's Family JAKARTA, Nov 17, 2025 - (ACN Newswire) - Indonesia's state-owned social security agency PT TASPEN (Persero) has reiterated its commitment to ensuring social protection for all Indonesian Civil Servants and State Officials, including those stationed abroad. President Director Taspen, Rony Hanityo (2nd left) delivers Work Accident Security Program benefits to the wife of the late Zetro Leonardo Purba, Junior Chancellery Officer at the Indonesian Embassy in Lima, Peru, who died while performing official duties on Sept 1, 2025. The statement follows TASPEN's recent distribution of Work Accident Security Program (Jaminan Kecelakaan Kerja/JKK) benefits to the family of the late Zetro Leonardo Purba, a Junior Chancellery Officer at the Indonesian Embassy in Lima, Peru, who died while performing official duties on September 1, 2025. TASPEN Corporate Secretary Henra expressed condolences to the bereaved family and underscored the agency's role in upholding the state's responsibility to protect civil servants serving anywhere in the world. \"TASPEN expresses its deepest condolences on the passing of Mr. Zetro Leonardo. The distribution of these benefits is proof that TASPEN carries out its state mandate with integrity and accountability. It is our responsibility to ensure that every civil servant's dedication - even at the farthest corners of the world - is accompanied by a sense of security for them and their families. The state's protection knows no borders,\" said Aprianto. As of September 30, 2025, TASPEN has provided JKK benefits to 221 heirs of Indonesian civil servants, including those serving on overseas assignments - a reflection of the government's continued commitment to the welfare of public sector workers worldwide. Comprehensive Protection for Civil Servants and Families The assistance provided to Mr. Purba's family includes Old-Age Savings Program (Tabungan Hari Tua/THT) and Work Accident Security Program benefits, such as Death Benefits/Bereavement Benefits, Death Compensation, and Funeral Benefit. In addition, Scholarship Benefit has been granted for two of his children to support their continued education - part of TASPEN's broader effort to ensure long-term family welfare. The Work Accident Security Program (JKK) forms part of Indonesia's national social protection framework for civil servants and state officials who experience work-related accidents, occupational illnesses, or death while performing state duties - whether domestically or abroad. Four Key Programs Supporting Civil Servants TASPEN manages four major programs designed to create an integrated and sustainable social security system for civil servants: 1. Old-Age Savings Program (THT): A savings and protection plan for employees nearing retirement or their families in case of death before retirement. 2. Pension Program: Guarantees a regular post-retirement income as recognition of civil servants' long-term service. 3. Work Accident Security Program (JKK): Covers the risk of workplace injuries, illnesses, or death occurring in the line of duty, including while serving abroad. 4. Death Security Program (Jaminan Kematian/JKM): Provides compensation and educational scholarships for the families of civil servants who pass away from non-work-related causes. These programs establish a comprehensive social safety net that protects civil servants throughout their professional and personal lives. TASPEN's initiatives reflect the Indonesian government's principle that public service deserves lifelong protection - regardless of where it is carried out. By extending coverage beyond national boundaries, the TASPEN ensures that Indonesian civil servants serving on global missions receive the same level of welfare assurance as those at home.

But we are seeing a trend in how tech companies are sleeping on piles of money, but they aren't just sleeping on it. They're sharing big plans to spend on it, and especially to spend on AI infrastructure. Michael Calore: Right. Data centers. Lauren Goode: Yeah, more data centers. Not just data centers, but yes, that's a big part of it. Michael Calore: And this is all partly what is fueling all of this talk about a bubble, which we touched on a little bit a couple of weeks ago with our colleague Molly Taft. But today we are going to be talking about AI bubble mania. Lauren Goode: Yes, we are. And our guest today has a lot to say about it. The writer Brian Merchant is joining us. Brian, welcome to WIRED's Uncanny Valley . We're really thrilled to have you here, although we're not super thrilled about the topic we're talking about. How are you doing today? Brian Merchant: Oh, I am as well as can be, I think. Yeah, thanks for having me. I am thrilled to get into the ins and outs of bubbledom with you both. Michael Calore: This is WIRED's Uncanny Valley , a show about the people, power, and influence of Silicon Valley. It feels like suddenly everyone started talking about the AI bubble and whether we're in one right now. Since this summer, when OpenAI's Sam Altman casually mentioned the possibility of an AI bubble, the debate has only grown louder. Just last week, Bill Gates told CNBC that yes, we are in a bubble, but added that just like in the dotcom era, \u201csomething profound,\u201d will come out of it. Perhaps he means an insane amount of money for the founders of chipmaker Nvidia, which just became the world's first $5 trillion company. For context that is 2.5 times the entire Canadian economy. Investments in AI are still flowing at full blast, and there are no signs of the money slowing down. Big Tech is already on track to spend $400 billion on artificial intelligence this year, and that is still not enough. Google Meta, Microsoft, and Amazon are pledging even more money in 2026. And yet, according to some reports, 95 percent of businesses currently using AI say that they're seeing little to no return. So are we in a bubble or not? And if we are, how do we even assess that, and what is the potential fallout if the bubble bursts. To make sense of this, we have Brian on the show today. Recently, Brian used a historical framework ",

New York City's comptroller, Brad Lander, on November 19, 2024. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images THE NEW YORK SUN Published: Nov. 17, 2025 03:52 PM ET Updated: Nov. 17, 2025 04:34 PM ET Gift this article Share Retirees beware: Democratic politicians are escalating their effort to play political games with public pension dollars. Nationwide, some $6 trillion is set aside in government employee retirement funds. Yet politicians in blue cities and states increasingly aim to use this money to promote a left-wing agenda. Ignoring the interests of the retirees, leftists want to use the money to push, say, opposition to Israel, anti-Trump \u201cresistance,\u201d or even animus for Elon Musk. Count on this issue to emerge as a flash point at New York City under the impending mayoralty of Zohran Mamdani. The city\u2019s public pension fund, to the tune of some $300 billion, runs the risk of becoming a kind of political shlushfund. The outgoing comptroller, Brad Lander, had reduced the fund\u2019s holdings, dating back to the 1970s, in Israeli government debt. Mr. Lander denied any political motive, and the fund still holds private Israeli debt. Yet critics questioned the timing of Mr. Lander\u2019s move, especially amid a larger left-wing climate of hostility toward Israel. Mayor Eric Adams\u2019 first deputy mayor, Randy Mastro, demanded an explanation as to why the bonds were not renewed when they matured. \u201cThis divestment, occurring amid a global \u2018Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions\u2019 campaign against Israel, appears to be in furtherance of that BDS campaign,\u201d Mr. Mastro said. The city\u2019s incoming comptroller, Mark Levine, has vowed to reinvest in the Israeli bonds. Yet this could set in motion a collision course with the mayor-elect, who, per the Times, \u201chas for years been an outspoken supporter of the movement to boycott Israel,\u201d and \u201cis likely to oppose such reinvestment.\u201d It would be a mistake, though, to make investment decisions merely to make hay with voters, rather than on logical financial grounds. Feature, say, the demarche by the treasurer of Chicago, Melissa Conyears-Ervin, to cease investing in American Treasury debt as a protest against President Trump\u2019s enforcement of immigration laws. Ms. Conyears-Ervin, who has thrown her hat in the ring for a seat in Congress, \u201cwill forego those risk-free investments,\u201d Politico reports, until Mr. Trump orders federal authorities to \u201cstop putting guns to the heads of American citizens,\u201d as she puts it. \u201cWe will not bankroll Donald Trump to terrorize American citizens,\u201d the Windy City wisewoman warns. She calls for other localities to follow suit: \u201cIf we do join together, imagine the message that would be sent to Washington, D.C., to Donald Trump.\u201d Yet as was well-marked by the Wall Street Journal in an editorial on Friday, this move could be counterproductive for Chicago. The city, after all, per Politico, is \u201ccash-strapped\u201d with \u201csinking credit ratings.\u201d Chicago\u2019s self-defeating avoidance of federal debt follows moves earlier this year by liberal politicians to take on Tesla and deploy public pension funds to torment the company\u2019s chief executive, Elon Musk. Since the city pension fund held Tesla stock, Mr. Lander had called for a shareholder lawsuit against the crusty carmaker, claiming that Mr. Musk\u2019s work at the White House had caused \u201cthe company\u2019s shares to plunge.\u201d Mr. Lander\u2019s call to sue Tesla stoked fears about Democrats deploying public pension funds to score points against political foes. Liberals, Mr. Musk said, were putting \u201cpressure on me and Tesla so I stop doing this.\u201d Such efforts, if conducted in a concerted manner, could foreseeably cause harm to companies who run afoul of liberal politicians. Beneficiaries of public pensions also face the risk of collateral damage as the left extends politics to finance.

Read part one here . Globalization has always had its critics \u2013 but until recently , they have come mainly from the left rather than the right. In the wake of the Second World War, as the world economy grew rapidly under US dominance, many on the left argued that the gains of globalization were unequally distributed, increasing inequality in rich countries while forcing poorer countries to implement free-market policies such as opening up their financial markets, privatizing their state industries and rejecting expansionary fiscal policies in favour of debt repayment \u2013 all of which mainly benefited US corporations and banks. This was not a new concern. Back in 1841, German economist Friedrich List had argued that free trade was designed to keep Britain\u2019s global dominance from being challenged, suggesting: When anyone has obtained the summit of greatness, he kicks away the ladder by which he climbs up, in order to deprive others of the means of climbing up after him. By the 1990s, critics of the US vision of a global world order such as the Nobel-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz argued that globalization in its current form benefited the US at the expense of developing countries and workers \u2013 while author and activist Naomi Klein focused on the negative environmental and cultural consequences of the global expansion of multinational companies. Left-led mass demonstrations broke out, disrupting global economic meetings including, most famously, the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 1999. During this \u201cbattle of Seattle, \u201d violent exchanges between protesters and police prevented the launch of a new world trade round that had been backed by the US president, Bill Clinton. For a while, the mass mobilization of a coalition of trade unionists, environmentalists and anti-capitalist protesters seemed set to challenge the path towards further globalization \u2013 with anti-capitalism \u201cOccupy\u201d protests spreading around the world in the wake of the 2008 financial crash. In the US, a further critique of globalization centered on its domestic consequences for American workers \u2013 namely, job losses and lower pay \u2013 and led to calls for greater protectionism. Although initially led by trade unions and some Democratic politicians, this critique gradually gained purchase in radical right circles that opposed giving any role to international organizations such as the WTO, on the grounds that they impinged on American sovereignty. According to this view, only by stopping foreign competition whose low wages undercut American workers could prosperity be restored. Immigration was another target. Donald Trump in his second term as US president has transformed these criticisms into radical, deeply disruptive economic and social policies \u2013 with tariffs and protectionism at their heart. In so doing, Trump \u2013 despite all his grandstanding on the world stage \u2013 has confirmed what has long been clear to close observers of US politics and business: that the American century of global dominance, with the dollar as unrivaled number one currency , is drawing rapidly to a close.

Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to give London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan and other civic chiefs the powers to impose a levy on an overnight stay. Earlier this year, Sir Sadiq made the case for a tourist tax, arguing that visitors to other European cities do not mind paying an \u201cextra few euros\u201d which could be used to encourage more tourism. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement The London tourist tax could raise \u00a3250 million a year. (REUTERS) The money is not expected to be used to fund public services in the city, or to lead to a cut in central Government funding for City Hall. But instead it could be used to make London, already one of the world\u2019s greatest tourist cities, an even more attractive place to visit. UKHospitality, which represents hotels, pubs and clubs, slammed the tourist tax plans as \u201cshocking\u201d and warned that they would \u201conly serve to ramp up prices and drive inflation\u201d. Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan (Jordan Pettitt/PA) (PA Wire) But Sir Sadiq made clear earlier this year that any proposals, which would be drawn up in consultation with the hotel and other affected sectors, would aim to further increase tourism. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement A spokesperson for the Mayor of London, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on speculation, but the Mayor has been clear that a modest tourist levy, similar to other international cities, would boost our economy, deliver growth and help cement London\u2019s reputation as a global tourism and business destination.\u201d New York, Tokyo, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague already have a tourist tax, as does Paris which has a range of charges including 3.25 euros (\u00a32.86) for an overnight stay in a two-star hotel and 8.45 euros (\u00a37.43) for a four-star hotel. \u201cThe thing about those cities is, many of us visit them, and don\u2019t really mind paying the extra few euros, in relation to a tourism levy,\u201d said Sir Sadiq, speaking at Mayor\u2019s Question Time in March. \u201cThe Government should be looking at giving us the powers to have an accommodation levy. But my promise to the hotels and Airbnbs and so forth is the money would be used to improve the environment around that, to encourage more tourists .\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement He stressed it would be \u201cunfair\u201d if the funds raised were siphoned away from helping to boost tourism and that this sector needed \u201creassurance\u201d that it would benefit from the levy. Ms Reeves has previously been sceptical about a tourist tax but is believed to have now been persuaded of its merits and that it would not hit tourist numbers. Paris imposes a tourist tax (REUTERS) The powers to charge a tourist tax could be introduced through the English Devolution and Community Empowerment Bill, which is going through Parliament. The levy could be applied to hotels, Airbnb-style accommodation and short lets. In Westminster alone there are more than 10,500 homes used as holiday lets. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement West End chiefs say the lack of VAT-free shopping for foreign visitors, which has also been called a \u201ctourist tax\u201d , and the cost of visas is driving people to head to cities such as Paris and Milan rather than London. But they believe an overnight levy could work if done properly. Dee Corsi, chief executive of the New West End Company, said: \"Tourism is vital to London\u2019s economy. It is international tourists who drive growth here in the West End. \u201cManaged properly, an overnight levy could strengthen the tourism economy - but only if businesses have a say. \u201cIf a levy is introduced, it must be retained locally, affordable, and tied to a wider visitor economy strategy. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \"Get its design and rollout wrong, and we risk undermining the very tourism sector we are looking to for growth.\u201d Andrew Carter, Chief Executive of Centre for Cities, said: \u201cLondon is the largest city in the G7 without any form of tourist levy. The Chancellor ought to change this. \u201cThis kind of tourist levy is common across Europe and used in major cities like New York. \u201cIf London had the same power, this would give the Mayor an incentive to attract more visitors and grow the local tourist economy.\u201d John Dickie, Chief Executive of business group BusinessLDN, stressed: \u201cAn overnight stay levy has the potential to benefit London and businesses but only i",

Even before Trump first took office in 2017, the US had begun to withdraw from its leadership role in international economic institutions such as the WTO. Now, the strongest part of its economy, the high-tech sector, is under intense pressure from China, whose economy is already bigger than that of the United States by one key measure of GDP. Meanwhile, facing the majority of US citizens are stagnant incomes, higher prices and more insecure jobs. In previous centuries, when first France and then Great Britain reached the end of their eras of world domination, these transitions had painful impacts beyond their borders. This time, with the global economy more closely integrated than ever before and no single dominant power waiting in the wings to take over, the impacts could be felt even more widely \u2013 with very damaging, if not catastrophic, results.

The average UK household is now estimated to be 16% poorer than it would have been had that crisis never occurred. Author Nick Kotucha ESRC Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Warwick Given that average annual household income is around \u00a355,200 , this suggests each one is losing out to the tune of \u00a38,800 per year. Globally, it is estimated that around 100 million more people are living in absolute poverty as a direct result of the crisis. Meanwhile, government debt levels around the world increased by a third . Ever since the crisis, the general consensus among politicians and economists seems to have been that tight financial regulation is necessary to ensure a similar disaster does not happen again. The Bank of England in particular has been a global leader in pushing for new types of international safeguards. Now though, the UK government is leading calls for financial red tape to be cut . Breaking from its traditional position as an advocate for strong regulation, the Labour party has promised \u201cthe most wide-ranging package of reforms to financial services regulation in more than a decade\u201d. The idea is that easing up on the rules will boost growth by encouraging bank lending and attracting international finance. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, appears to believe that strict regulation has dampened activity in a sector which the UK economy relies upon. As his chancellor Rachel Reeves put it , existing regulation \u201chas gone too far in seeking to eliminate risk\u201d. And it\u2019s true that some regulation has been overly complex while producing few tangible benefits. But the changes signalled by Reeves and Starmer point to a much broader project of rolling back key safeguards that were put in place to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. This year, some of the regulations aimed at limiting risky mortgage lending \u2013 a key cause of the 2008 crisis \u2013 have been loosened. And Reeves has promised further sweeping changes which would, for instance, dismantle key parts of the \u201cringfencing\u201d regime which separates risky investment banking from retail banking.

From potential cuts to tax relief to new limits on salary sacrifice, millions of savers could see the way they build and access their retirement income altered. Reeves needs to plug a \u00a320bn to \u00a330bn gap in the public finances, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), but she has downplayed this figure. New Feature In Short Quick Stories. Same trusted journalism. With so many proposals still in play, uncertainty is growing for anyone planning their financial future. Here, The i Paper explores the key pension tax changes that could be announced next Wednesday \u2013 and what they might mean for you. Cuts to tax relief on pension contributions When workers pay into a pension, the government adds a top-up known as tax relief. This boosts savings by at least 20 per cent, and even more for higher-rate taxpayers on 40 per cent or 45 per cent \u2013 making it one of the most valuable incentives for retirement saving. Each year, speculation swirls about a clampdown aimed at making the system less generous for higher earners. Experts say such a move is unlikely this time, but if Reeves does act, she could abolish higher-rate relief or introduce a flat 30 per cent rate, according to Stephen Barber, professor of global affairs at the University ",

The average UK household is now estimated to be 16% poorer than it would have been had that crisis never occurred. Author Nick Kotucha ESRC Postdoctoral Fellow, University of Warwick Given that average annual household income is around \u00a355,200 , this suggests each one is losing out to the tune of \u00a38,800 per year. Globally, it is estimated that around 100 million more people are living in absolute poverty as a direct result of the crisis. Meanwhile, government debt levels around the world increased by a third . Ever since the crisis, the general consensus among politicians and economists seems to have been that tight financial regulation is necessary to ensure a similar disaster does not happen again. The Bank of England in particular has been a global leader in pushing for new types of international safeguards. Now though, the UK government is leading calls for financial red tape to be cut . Breaking from its traditional position as an advocate for strong regulation, the Labour party has promised \"the most wide-ranging package of reforms to financial services regulation in more than a decade\". The idea is that easing up on the rules will boost growth by encouraging bank lending and attracting international finance. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, appears to believe that strict regulation has dampened activity in a sector which the UK economy relies upon. As his chancellor Rachel Reeves put it , existing regulation \"has gone too far in seeking to eliminate risk\". And it's true that some regulation has been overly complex while producing few tangible benefits. But the changes signalled by Reeves and Starmer point to a much broader project of rolling back key safeguards that were put in place to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. This year, some of the regulations aimed at limiting risky mortgage lending - a key cause of the 2008 crisis - have been loosened. And Reeves has promised further sweeping changes which would, for instance, dismantle key parts of the \"ringfencing\" regime which separates risky investment banking from retail banking. In doing so, she is ignoring repeated warnings by regulators (including the Bank of England) who stress that such moves will make the financial system much less stable. The risks attached to these changes are even more worrying in an environment where Donald Trump is pushing an aggressive agenda against regulation. The US and UK are both hesitant about implementing the newest version of an international framework for banking regulation which is widely regarded as critical to continued financial stability. The future of that framework will be uncertain if two of the world's biggest financial superpowers withdraw their support. Risky business Starmer clearly feels under pressure to do something to combat the UK's sluggish economic growth . But if one lesson can be taken from the 2008 crisis, it is that a small boost to economic growth at the expense of long-term stability will ultimately result in much greater losses. Even in the absence of a full-blown financial crisis, the Bank of England thinks that the higher level of instability and uncertainty associated with a laxer regulatory regime will cancel out any small short-term benefits. This chimes with the findings of my latest research , which shows that even these short-term gains are far from guaranteed. Underlying the new enthusiasm for deregulation seems to be a belief that the financial system is now stable enough to withstand economic shocks, even if regulations are rolled back. But recent events clearly show that the risk of a financial crisis continues to bubble near the surface. Just two years ago, problems at the relatively small Silicon Valley Bank led to a bank-run which had spillover effects across the US. In the UK, Liz Truss's infamous mini-budget of 2022 led to a dramatic spike in government bond yields and cause",

Read our privacy notice . A tourist tax is set to be introduced in London which would see visitors staying overnight in hotels and Airbnb-style accommodation charged a small levy. Chancellor Rachel Reeves is expected to give London mayor Sir Sadiq Khan and other civic chiefs the powers to impose a levy on an overnight stay. Earlier this year, Sir Sadiq made the case for a tourist tax, arguing that visitors to other European cities do not mind paying an \u201cextra few euros\u201d which could be used to encourage more tourism. The London tourist tax could raise \u00a3250 million a year. REUTERS The money is not expected to be used to fund public services in the city, or to lead to a cut in central Government funding for City Hall. But instead it could be used to make London, already one of the world\u2019s greatest tourist cities, an even more attractive place to visit. UKHospitality, which represents hotels, pubs and clubs, slammed the tourist tax plans as \u201cshocking\u201d and warned that they would \u201conly serve to ramp up prices and drive inflation\u201d. Mayor of London Sir Sadiq Khan (Jordan Pettitt/PA) PA Wire But Sir Sadiq made clear earlier this year that any proposals, which would be drawn up in consultation with the hotel and other affected sectors, would aim to further increase tourism. A spokesperson for the Mayor of London, said: \u201cWe don\u2019t comment on speculation, but the Mayor has been clear that a modest tourist levy, similar to other international cities, would boost our economy, deliver growth and help cement London\u2019s reputation as a global tourism and business destination.\u201d New York, Tokyo, Lisbon, Barcelona and Prague already have a tourist tax, as does Paris which has a range of charges including 3.25 euros (\u00a32.86) for an overnight stay in a two-star hotel and 8.45 euros (\u00a37.43) for a four-star hotel. \u201cThe thing about those cities is, many of us visit them, and don\u2019t really mind paying the extra few euros, in relation to a tourism levy,\u201d said Sir Sadiq, speaking at Mayor\u2019s Question Time in March. \u201cThe Government should be looking at giving us the powers to have an accommodation levy. But my promise to the hotels and Airbnbs and so forth is the money would be used to improve the environment around that, to encourage more tourists .\u201d Read More Londoners who own expensive homes face Budget hammering after Reeves tax U-turn Seven questions for Rachel Reeves if she wants to help revive business London hotel tax: How much extra could it cost to visit the capital? Sponsored The best destinations and activities to book this winter He stressed it would be \u201cunfair\u201d if the funds raised were siphoned away from helping to boost tourism and that this sector needed \u201creassurance\u201d that it would benefit from the levy. Ms Reeves has previously been sceptical about a tourist tax but is believed to have now been persuaded of its merits and that it would not hit tourist numbers. Paris imposes a tourist tax REUTERS The powers to charge a tourist tax could be introduced through the English Devolution and Community Empowerment Bill, which is going through Parliament. The levy could be applied to hotels, Airbnb-style accommodation and short lets. In Westminster alone there are more than 10,500 homes used as holiday lets. West End chiefs say the lack of VAT-free shopping for foreign visitors, which has also been called a \u201ctourist tax\u201d , and the cost of visas is driving people to head to cities such as Paris and Milan rather than London. But they believe an overnight levy could work if done properly. Dee Corsi, chief executive of the New West End Company, said: \"Tourism is vital to London\u2019s economy. It is international tourists who drive growth here in the West End. \u201cManaged properly, an overnight levy could strengthen the tourism economy - but only if businesses have a say. \u201cIf a levy is introduced, it must be retained locally, affordable, and tied to a wider visitor economy strategy. \"Get its design and rollout wrong, and we risk undermining the very tourism sector we are looking to for growth.\u201d Andrew Car",

Moving abroad to enjoy the freedom retirement offers is by no means a new concept but, with more families spread across the UK and further afield, and the convenience of budget flights and cross-channel train routes , it\u2019s a more popular choice than ever before. However, there\u2019s no shortage of things to consider before setting up life in a different country and becoming part of a new community. Some destinations are much better set up than others to welcome Brits bidding farewell to their career. The cost of living, climate, access to high-quality healthcare, and visa and residency requirements differ significantly from country to country, making the process feel too daunting for some who crave a change. These are officially the best places to retire in the UK right now A new study has weighed up every constituency in the UK to assess the best places to live in later life Thankfully, Global Citizens Solutions has done much of the legwork for anyone considering such a move. Their most recent studies have highlighted the ten best countries for UK citizens to retire to, ensuring that the legal requirements, technical processes and all that\u2019s required of retirees are tailored to Brits considering new scenery. From the dazzling Greek islands to the beaches Down Under, these are the countries we\u2019re looking at escaping to for more than a fly-and-flop holiday. Outdoor trattoria in a quiant village in Tuscany, Italy Getty Images 10. Italy History, art, exceptional food and wine \u2013 you know the drill. Italy has fascinated Brits for centuries, each of us flocking to our preferred corner for some R&R and a well-deserved vitamin D top-up. However, older Brits are sticking around. One of the main draws is Italy\u2019s affordability, especially in regions like Abruzzo and Puglia , where monthly expenses are significantly lower than those back home. Rental prices, especially in more rural areas, are cheaper than in the UK, while a Golden Visa system grants residency through a minimum investment requirement of \u20ac250,000. St. Mary's Tower in Comino Island, Malta Getty Images 9. Malta English being an official language of this small but mighty Mediterranean island is a big draw for retirees, as is the fact that it\u2019s one of the warmest year-round destinations in Europe. The cost of living is significantly lower than in the UK, while high-quality healthcare is more affordable and easily accessible. Maltese citizenship and residency are attainable for non-EU citizens through investment, with a minimum investment requirement of \u20ac300,000 in real estate. Beach on Nevis island, St.Kitts and Nevis, Caribbean Getty Images 8. St. Kitts and Nevis What may seem like a rogue destination \u2013 especially considering its ranking above Italy and Malta \u2013 is an increasingly attractive destination for retiring UK citizens. Most significantly, St. Kitts and Nevis led the way in being the first country to introduce a citizenship-by-investment program; British citizens can qualify for citizenship by investment with a contribution of $250,000 to the country\u2019s Sustainable Island Development Fund (SIF). Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica Getty Images 7. Costa Rica One country rising in the ranks as one of the best places for UK citizens to retire is no stranger to the top spot on many travellers\u2019 bucket lists. The tropical Central American haven of Costa Rica is undoubtedly one of the world\u2019s most naturally beautiful places to enjoy later life, although the cost of living is a key factor to its appeal. A monthly budget of around \u00a31,000 is sufficient to live comfortably, while pension visa holders are exempt from paying tax on their overseas state pension. Aerial view of Maya bay, Thailand Getty Images 6. Thailand With flight prices to Europe on the rise in recent years, travellers have been heading further afield to get more bang for their buck.

The UK Government's Risky Rollback Of Financial Regulation Threatens Long-Term Growth Date 2025-11-17 09:06:56 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Author: long-term ( MENAFN - The Conversation) The financial crisis of 2008 left deep scars on the British economy. The average UK household is now estimated to be 16% poorer than it would have been had that crisis never occurred. Given that average annual household income is around \u00a355,200, this suggests each one is losing out to the tune of \u00a38,800 per year. Globally, it is estimated that around 100 million more people are living in absolute poverty as a direct result of the crisis. Meanwhile, government debt levels around the world increased by a third. Ever since the crisis, the general consensus among politicians and economists seems to have been that tight financial regulation is necessary to ensure a similar disaster does not happen again. The Bank of England in particular has been a global leader in pushing for new types of international safeguards. Now though, the UK government is leading calls for financial red tape to be cut. Breaking from its traditional position as an advocate for strong regulation, the Labour party has promised\u201cthe most wide-ranging package of reforms to financial services regulation in more than a decade\u201d. The idea is that easing up on the rules will boost growth by encouraging bank lending and attracting international finance. The prime minister, Keir Starmer, appears to believe that strict regulation has dampened activity in a sector which the UK economy relies upon. As his chancellor Rachel Reeves put it, existing regulation\u201chas gone too far in seeking to eliminate risk\u201d. And it's true that some regulation has been overly complex while producing few tangible benefits. But the changes signalled by Reeves and Starmer point to a much broader project of rolling back key safeguards that were put in place to avoid a repeat of the financial crisis. This year, some of the regulations aimed at limiting risky mortgage lending \u2013 a key cause of the 2008 crisis \u2013 have been loosened. And Reeves has promised further sweeping changes which would, for instance, dismantle key parts of the\u201cringfencing\u201d regime which separates risky investment banking from retail banking. In doing so, she is ignoring repeated warnings by regulators (including the Bank of England) who stress that such moves will make the financial system much less stable. The risks attached to these changes are even more worrying in an environment where Donald Trump is pushing an aggressive agenda against regulation. The US and UK are both hesitant about implementing the newest version of an international framework for banking regulation which is widely regarded as critical to continued financial stability. The future of that framework will be uncertain if two of the world's biggest financial superpowers withdraw their support. Risky business Starmer clearly feels under pressure to do something to combat the UK's sluggish economic growth. But if one lesson can be taken from the 2008 crisis, it is that a small boost to economic growth at the expense of long-term stability will ultimately result in much greater losses. Even in the absence of a full-blown financial crisis, the Bank of England thinks that the higher level of instability and uncertainty associated with a laxer regulatory regime will cancel out any small short-term benefits. This chimes with the findings of my latest research, which shows that even these short-term gains are far from guaranteed. Point taken. Adam Vaughan/EPA Underlying the new enthusiasm for deregulation seems to be a belief that the financial system is now stable enough to withstand economic shocks, even if regulations are rolled back. But recent events clearly show that the risk of a financial crisis continues to bubble near the surface. Just two years ago, problems at the relatively small Silicon Valley Bank led to a bank-run which had spillover effects across the US. In the UK, Liz Truss's infamous mini-budget of 2022 led to a dramatic spike in gove",

BECOME A SUPPORTER \u201cI only looked backwards\u201d: A letter to my great grandchildren by Rex Patrick | Nov 18, 2025 | Comment & Analysis , Latest Posts Image: Aaron Burden, Unsplash MWM has a scoop; a letter from 2075, written by a former right-wing politician to his eight great grandchildren. Rex Patrick Junior reports on the deathbed confessions of a man who got it wrong. Spoiler Alert : The name of the politician will be revealed at the end of the letter, but there is a risk you might work it out before you get there. Dear Great Grandkids, I\u2019m at the end of my life; you\u2019re at the start of yours. You live in a world where you wake to lights powered by solar, wind and tidal flows and breathe air uncontaminated by the burning of coal and gas, or vehicle exhaust emissions. Your gen-six robot brings you your morning coffee, made from clean and perfectly fresh water pumped from the sea via a local desalination plant, which you can sip on as you ponder what life might have been like had we not hit net zero 25 years ago. Perhaps you might instead be turning your minds to how you\u2019re going to capitalise on your standard four months\u2019 annual leave, made possible because of productivity efficiencies of AI and a transformed economy that distributed wealth generated from technology. A visit to the revitalised rivers and forest using your long-range electric vehicles might be in order. My descendants, I served in the Australian Parliament for two and a half decades, stepping away from politics in 2039. I was popular with my regional constituents, but with the benefit of hindsight, I now know I didn\u2019t serve them, or you, well. The wonderful lives that you and they have today are not the result of my work; rather, it\u2019s because I caused people to ignore me. I spent my life in politics looking backwards. I write this letter urging you to look forwards. *** Before taking on the role of chief-of-staff to an interesting, but similarly \u2018visioned\u2019 politician named Barnaby, I worked for the Productivity Commission. I could have learned a lot from my experience, but I never really got the reality of what makes an economy grow. Sure, a growing population can feed economic growth, as can more land and more resources, but that only takes a country so far. Countries need to innovate so that they can do more with what they have, and new ideas need to be encoded into new technologies. But I just kept pressing for more of the same, like export of coal, gas and raw materials. I was happy for Australia to just be the world\u2019s best quarry. I was so hooked on this that I used to dress up in workers\u2019 clothes, in hard hats and high-viz vests, to show my runaway enthusiasm for digging things up and fluffing them off as fast as possible. Some other countries were at least smart enough to establish sovereign wealth funds and fill them with cash from the sale of resources. Not Australia \u2013 I watched, from my position as the Minister for Resources, as our resources disappeared over the horizon on foreign-owned and operated ships, with not a dollar paid to us for them. Australia was the land of free resources. That\u2019s one of the reasons why Australians are now less well off than the people of many other smaller countries, including Norway. Australia needs a sovereign wealth fund like Norway for the next boom \u2013 electrification I\u2019m ashamed to say that your great-grandfather worked hard against renewables. I know you\u2019ll find that hard to believe, noting the abundance of cheap renewable energy we\u2019ve enjoyed for decades \u2026 and just the idea that you would burn fuel to make electricity is unthinkable now. *** I used to portray th",

(Credit: Eric Bowling) Calls to address the widening gap in property taxes and business attraction between the City of Edmonton and the surrounding communities are coming from both inside and outside the house, with one councillor presenting some outside-the-box ideas to help ease the city\u2019s fiscal woes. Ward Dene Coun. Aaron Paquette unveiled his \u201cmoney plan\u201d at the Building Owners and Managers Association of Edmonton (BOMA) annual general meeting on Nov. 4. Speaking with Postmedia, he outlined his long-term plan on how to bring more businesses within the city and curb property tax growth. \u201cComing out of COVID-19 and unprecedented inflation, and now the tariffs \u2014 and also the deep provincial cuts, our budget has taken a beating,\u201d he said. \u201cWe could have the most efficient budget on the planet and you can beat the budget into submission, but you can\u2019t beat math. We are headed to an iceberg.\u201d Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement While many say the solution is to find more efficiencies in the city\u2019s budget and potentially find programs to cut to bring expenses down, Paquette, who has sat on two consecutive councils and gone through eight city budget deliberations, said the city has located all the budget efficiencies there are to be found. \u201cWe\u2019ve scraped the cupboards dry,\u201d Paquette said. \u201cThere is no buffer here. People wouldn\u2019t believe it, because optics are everything but we\u2019re running lean.\u201d Instead, he says the solution is for the city to build alternative revenue streams to property tax collection \u2014 he has his eye on the Ed Tel Endowment Fund, which was established in the late 1990s when Edmonton Telephones Corporation was sold to Telus for $400 million after then-premier Don Getty privatized Alberta Government Telephones. Since then, the fund has grown to a value of $1-billion \u2014 the city currently uses $48 million of interest per year to offset property taxes and the rest goes back into the principal. Paquette wants to get it up to $6 billion within 10 to 15 years, which he says would mean the city would stop having to increase property taxes to keep the lights on. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \u201cWe\u2019ve got to become as fiscally independent as humanly possible,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need a sovereign wealth fund. Obviously Norway did their thing, we were supposed to do it with the Heritage Trust fund but we never did \u2014 but can we do it in Edmonton? Yes \u2014 we already have the base for it. \u201cIf it was $4 billion today, our tax rate increase would be zero per cent. The future has a funny way of sneaking up on you really quick, so when we get there let\u2019s make sure we\u2019ve done everything we can to make this fund be so large that it pays for our tax increases and gives us a buffer against economic stress. \u201cThe real solution is moving away from relying on just fees and taxes and saying \u2018How can we become a corporation that creates surpluses?\u2019 As a municipality you can create surpluses, but those surpluses by law have to go back into services and tax reduction. So where\u2019s the problem there? It\u2019s a fantastic way to operate, it\u2019s just no one has thought to separate the corporate side from the governance side on the municipal level.\u201d Paquette said a report on the feasibility of his plan is due back sometime in the new year. Businesses incentivized to move just outside city limits Solutions can\u2019t come fast enough for Bronwyn Scrivens, who is a real estate broker specializing in industrial properties. She\u2019s been sounding the alarm for months that larger businesses may be passing the city by when it comes to new locations to protect their bottom line. Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement \u201cMy entire day job is basically moving businesses outside the city of Edmonton,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so much more cost-effective and makes a lot more sense. In terms of permit timelines and ability to get the land they want, there\u2019s a combination of factors that are incentivizing these businesses to move literally just outside the city of Edmonton. \u201cIt makes no difference to them whether they\u2019re in northwest Edmonton or Acheson. It\u2019s a five minute drive.\u201d Noting the location of a $10 million dollar building could mean a difference in over $150,000 in property taxes depending on where it is built, ",

France Raises Concerns Over EU Loan to Ukraine Date 2025-11-17 06:14:32 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter ( MENAFN ) French Foreign Minister Jean Noel Barrot stated on Sunday that Kiev might never be able to repay a proposed EU loan backed by frozen Russian assets. According to Barrot, Paris is urging the G7 nations to provide financial assurances for this unprecedented initiative. The European Commission is considering issuing a \u20ac140 billion ($160 billion) loan secured against immobilized Russian sovereign assets held at the Euroclear clearing house in Belgium. Under this proposal, Ukraine would be required to repay the loan only if it receives reparations from Russia after the conflict concludes\u2014a scenario that many experts deem unlikely. The plan has encountered resistance from Belgium, which holds the majority of Russian assets at Euroclear. Brussels has insisted that all EU member states share the financial and legal responsibilities tied to this arrangement. Barrot explained that France has its own conditions for the proposed loan. He emphasized that Russian assets serving as collateral must not be \u201cconfiscated\u201d to prevent legal complications. He further stated that G7 countries should provide guarantees alongside EU nations \u201cso that they carry the financial risk associated with this loan together with us,\u201d while acknowledging that \u201cwe do not have absolute certainty that it will be repaid.\u201d Additionally, Paris has insisted that the loan funds be allocated \u201con the military\u201d in a manner that \u201callows us to develop our\u2026 defense industry.\u201d The EU has been seeking guarantees for the loan from multiple countries. Recently, Norway declined to utilize its \u20ac1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) sovereign wealth fund as a financial backstop for the plan, highlighting the challenges in securing international support.

Russian assets used as collateral for the loan should not be \u201cconfiscated\u201d to prevent legal complications, he stated. He further stressed that G7 nations should provide guarantees alongside EU members \u201cso that they carry the financial risk associated with this loan together with us,\u201d noting that \u201cwe do not have absolute certainty that it will be repaid.\u201d Additionally, Paris has requested that the loan be allocated \u201con the military\u201d in a manner that \u201callows us to develop our\u2026 defense industry.\u201d The EU has already approached several nations to secure backing for the loan. Last week, Norway declined to use its \u20ac1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) sovereign wealth fund as a financial support for the scheme.

French FM warns Ukraine may struggle to repay EU-backed loan Date 2025-11-17 03:51:49 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter ( MENAFN ) French Foreign Minister Jean Noel Barrot said Sunday that Kiev might never be able to repay a proposed EU loan secured with frozen Russian assets. Paris is seeking G7 backing to provide financial guarantees for the plan, he added. The EU Commission proposes issuing a \u20ac140 billion ($160 billion) loan using immobilized Russian sovereign assets held at Belgium\u2019s Euroclear clearing house. Ukraine would only repay if it obtains reparations from Russia after the conflict, a scenario widely considered unlikely. Belgium, which holds most of the Russian assets at Euroclear, has opposed the plan and demanded that all EU members share the financial and legal risks. Barrot said France also has conditions for the loan. Russian assets used as collateral should not be \u201cconfiscated\u201d to avoid legal complications, and G7 nations should share the financial risk with EU members. He stressed, \u201cwe do not have absolute certainty that it will be repaid.\u201d Paris also requires that the loan be allocated \u201con the military\u201d to support the development of its defense industry. The EU has sought guarantees from several nations. Norway last week refused to use its \u20ac1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) sovereign wealth fund as a backstop, while Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico said his country would not support the plan. EU leaders postponed a final decision on asset confiscation at an October summit, deferring it to a December European Council meeting. Russia has warned that using its frozen assets to fund Ukraine would be theft and claimed there is \u201cno legal way\u201d for Brussels to implement the plan.

Kiev doesn\u2019t have capability to repay loan\u2014 French FM Date 2025-11-17 03:23:55 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter ( MENAFN ) France has voiced serious reservations about a proposed EU initiative to issue a major loan to Kiev based on frozen Russian funds, with French Foreign Minister Jean Noel Barrot cautioning that there is \u201cno certainty\u201d the money would ever be repaid. Speaking to reporters, Barrot emphasized that Kiev may never return the funds under the current structure. As stated by reports, Paris wants G7 countries to share responsibility for the financial risks tied to what would be an unprecedented arrangement. The EU Commission is pushing for a \u20ac140 billion ($160 billion) loan backed by Russian sovereign assets currently immobilized at a clearing institution in Belgium. Under this proposal, Ukraine would only be required to repay the loan if it eventually receives reparations from Russia at the end of the conflict \u2014 a scenario that many observers consider improbable. Belgium, which holds the majority of the frozen assets, has pushed back, insisting that all EU members must jointly shoulder the legal and financial exposure. According to Barrot, France also has several conditions attached to the plan. He stressed that the Russian assets used as collateral must not be \u201cconfiscated\u201d, citing legal concerns. He also argued that G7 members should provide guarantees \u201cso that they carry the financial risk associated with this loan together with us,\u201d adding plainly that \u201cwe do not have absolute certainty that it will be repaid.\u201d In addition, Paris is calling for the funds to be allocated \u201con the military\u201d in a way that \u201callows us to develop our\u2026 defense industry.\u201d The EU has been searching for partners willing to offer guarantees, but progress has been limited. Norway recently declined to use its \u20ac1.8 trillion ($2 trillion) sovereign wealth fund as a safeguard, and Slovakia\u2019s prime minister made it clear that his country would not endorse the plan. EU leaders were unable to reach a consensus on the matter during their October summit, pushing a final decision to a meeting scheduled for December. Russia, for its part, has repeatedly warned that any attempt to redirect its frozen assets toward Ukraine would constitute theft and insists there is \u201cno legal way\u201d for such a move.
